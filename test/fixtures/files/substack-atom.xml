Why not send the weakest students to the best colleges, since they need the most help? This is one of those questions that&#8217;s so naive it loops back and becomes interesting again.</p><p>To avoid corrupting the youth, we might provide an optimistic answer: anyone can teach addition, any college math major can teach calculus, but it takes a world expert to teach ten-dimensional hypertopology. We want to take the few students smart enough to learn hypertopology and connect them to the few experts smart enough to teach it. But this seems false; most of the classes at top colleges are the same material that gets taught everywhere else; you don&#8217;t get into subjects that need world experts until postgrad.</p><p>Another answer, still somewhat optimistic: we want to maximize the chance of geniuses doing revolutionary work. If we give a mediocre student the world&#8217;s best writing teacher, and a genius a mediocre writing teacher, they might each write a pretty good novel. But if we give a mediocre student a mediocre writing teacher, and the genius the world&#8217;s best writing teacher, then we might get one mediocre novel and one work of staggering genius which revolutionizes literature forever. Likewise, if we connect the world&#8217;s most talented young scientists to the world&#8217;s best science teachers and labs, maybe they&#8217;ll cross some threshold of understanding where they can discover a cure for cancer. I think this is the best explanation that sticks to optimistic prosocial answers.</p><p>(Is is true? An oft-cited paper, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w17159">Dale and Krueger</a>, appears to find that, controlling for applicant characteristics, people who attend more selective college don&#8217;t earn more money later in life. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/27/colleges-admissions-selective-schools/">a gesture at a challenge to these results</a>, apparently supported by Dale and Krueger themselves, though I can&#8217;t find any more information. Earnings are a poor proxy for &#8220;teaches better&#8221; - it would be great to have something like value-add to GRE scores - but AFAIK no study like that exists.)</p><p>What if we&#8217;re more cynical, and believe in the <a href="https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2021/10/19/why-higher-education-should-take-the-signalling-critique-seriously-and-what-that-might-look-like/">signaling theory of education</a>?</p><p>We could think of &#8220;the best college&#8221; as a self-fulfilling prophecy; for whatever reason, one college has gotten a reputation as the one whose signal is most valuable. Everyone naturally tries to get in there; if they fail, they go to the college with the next-best reputation, and so on. The system is stable; the &#8220;best&#8221; college will keep its reputation (since it gets the best students) and the best students will always want to go to the best college. If, as Matt&#8217;s son suggests, all the Ivies started accepting the worst students instead, an Ivy degree would soon become a signal that you&#8217;re bad, and employers would stop respecting it.</p><p>I heard a fascinating variation of this hypothesis from <a href="https://medium.com/@matthewjwatson/the-dirtbag-left-at-harvard-an-interview-with-chapo-trap-house-e5fca62780dc">Matt Christman of Chapo Trap House</a>: elite colleges are machines for laundering privilege.</p><p>That is: Harvard accepts (let&#8217;s say) 75% smart/talented people, and 25% rich/powerful people. This is a good deal for both sides. The smart people get to network with elites, which is the first step to becoming elite themselves. And the rich people get mixed in so thoroughly with a pool of smart/talented people that everyone assumes they must be smart/talented themselves. After all, they have a degree from Harvard!</p><p>The most blatant form of this obfuscation: suppose you own a very successful family business. You can leave your son your fortune, you can leave him the business, you can leave him your mansion, but you can&#8217;t (directly) leave him an aura of having deserved all these things. What you <em>can</em> do is make a $10 million donation to Harvard in exchange for them accepting your son. Your son gets a Harvard degree, a universally-recognized sign of being a highly meritorious person. Then when you leave him the business, everyone will agree he deserves it. Who said anything about nepotism? Leaving a Harvard graduate in control of your business is an excellent decision!</p><p>This happens a little, but I think it mostly isn&#8217;t this obvious. More often the transactions are for abstract goods: prestige, associations, favors. The Maharaja of Whereverstan sends his daughter to Harvard so that she appears meritorious. In exchange, Harvard gets the credibility boost of being the place the Maharaja of Whereverstan sent his daughter. And Harvard&#8217;s other students get the advantage of networking with the Princess Of Whereverstan. Twenty years later, when one of them is an oil executive and Whereverstan is handing out oil contracts, she puts in a word with her old college buddy the Princess and gets the deal. It&#8217;s obvious what the oil executive has gotten out of this, but what does the Princess get? I think she gets the right to say she went to Harvard, an honor which is known to go <em>mostly</em> to the meritorious.</p><p>People ask why Harvard admissions can still be bribed or influenced by the rich or well-connected. This is the wrong question: the right question is why they ever give spots based on merit at all. The answer is: otherwise the scheme wouldn&#8217;t work. The point of a money-laundering operation is to take in both fairly-earned and dirty money, then mix them together so thoroughly that nobody can tell which is which. Likewise, the point of a privilege-laundering operation is to take in both fairly-earned and dirty privilege, then stamp both with a Harvard degree. &#8220;Fairly-earned privilege&#8221; means all the brilliant talented ambitious youngsters admitted on the basis of their SAT scores and grades and impressive accomplishments; &#8220;dirty privilege&#8221; means the kids of various old-money aristocrats, foreign potentates, and ordinary super-rich people. Colleges mix them together, with advantages for both groups.</p><p>Is this good or bad? It&#8217;s good insofar as it provides a justification for making some elite positions dependent on merit and accessible to anyone, but bad insofar as it helps defend and obfuscate the ones that aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s good if you think it&#8217;s good for all the elites (meritocratic and otherwise) to know each other and be on the same page; it&#8217;s bad if you don&#8217;t want them to be (maybe because it helps them oppress people more efficiently). </p><p>I expect that without such a system the elites would do their own thing without any concession to merit whatsoever - so maybe it beats the alternative.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Open Thread 284]]></title><description><![CDATA[...]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-284</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-284</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 04:15:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6516b24-5d9a-4b63-8103-8d0de1e6fba6_255x255.webp" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the weekly visible open thread.

When you&#8217;ve read them all, I&#8217;ll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked</em>]</p><p>There is widespread agreement among philosophers, political commentators, and the general public that transparency in government is an unalloyed good. Louis Brandeis famously articulates the common wisdom: &#8220;Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman&#8221; (page 1).</p><p>Support for transparency is bipartisan. On his first day in office, Barack Obama said &#8220;My administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.&#8221; (page 1). On the Republican National Committee&#8217;s website, one reads &#8220;Republicans believe that transparency is essential for good governance. Elected officials should be held accountable for their actions in Washington, D.C.&#8221; (page 2)</p><p>And so it is. Legislators&#8217; votes are published and stored in public online databases, their deliberations are televised, and their every action is extensively documented.&nbsp;</p><p>We do not, however, embrace transparency in all aspects of government. Citizens vote by secret ballot to protect their votes from outside influence. The Federal Reserve meets in secret to avoid causing turmoil in financial markets. Most international diplomacy is conducted in secret. What accounts for the difference?</p><p>As with a surprising number of widespread assumptions, the public embrace of transparency suffers from a want of theoretical justification. The intuitive thought process begins with the assumption that politicians are inherently up to no good. They must therefore be watched as closely as possible so that we can temper their sordid tendencies. A more careful examination of transparency paints a much more complex story. Brian Kogelmann provides such an examination.</p><h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2><p>Our modern ideas about government transparency can be traced back to Jeremy Bentham. He advocated for radical transparency in government while also supporting a secret ballot for individuals. He believed that &#8220;men acting as representatives of all the people have a private and sinister interest, and sufficient power to gratify that interest, producing a constant sacrifice of the interest of the people&#8221; (page 23). What should be done about this? Publicity! For &#8220;Without publicity, all other checks are fruitless: in comparison of publicity, all other checks are of small account.&#8221; (page 24).&nbsp;</p><p>Bentham also shares our modern embrace of a secret ballot for citizens. On its face, there might seem to be a contradiction here. If citizens&#8217; votes were public, would that not also serve as a check against their being captured by sinister self interest? Some have bitten this bullet. John Stewart Mill, for example, thought that citizens <em>should</em> vote publicly so that they would be compelled to vote in the public interest rather than their own. Voting publicly might also increase trust in government by allowing us to easily check the results of any election. If there was a public database of votes, citizens could simply check whether their votes were counted accurately. Any concerns about election fraud would evaporate.</p><p>Bentham resolves the apparent contradiction by appealing to the idea that the votes of citizens should be <em>free</em>. By this he means free from outside influence &#8220;whether as terrorism or bribery&#8221; (page 24). The idea is that if citizens&#8217; votes were public, they would be subject to a variety of unsavory influences. Somebody might try to buy their vote, for instance. This was commonplace in the United States before the secret ballot was introduced. Also common was &#8220;terrorism,&#8221; simply threatening physical violence against anybody that didn&#8217;t vote in the appropriate manner. Organized crime was a fan of this tactic. The secret ballot removes these influences, ensuring that the only factor affecting an individual&#8217;s vote is the honest preference of that individual.</p><p>By contrast, Bentham absolutely does not want the votes of legislators to be <em>free</em>. He wants their votes to be tightly shackled to the preferences of their constituents. He wants the citizenry to essentially rule by terrorism, threatening to put legislators out of a job if they step out of line. This can only occur if those constituents can actually observe their legislators&#8217; votes. So there is, apparently, no contradiction.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Secret Ballot For Legislators</h2><p>Kogelmann does not think that the contradiction has been resolved. He argues that legislators face an incentive structure very similar to the one faced by citizens, and that a similar system should be adopted. In his words:</p><blockquote><p>...our political institutions ought to largely operate under a veil of secrecy. By secrecy, I mean this: when representatives vote on bills (either on the legislature floor or in committee), they do so by the secret ballot. Citizens will know which bills pass or fail, and they will know the total number of votes for and against each bill, but they will not know in which direction individual legislators cast their votes. Moreover, much of the debate over bills (especially in committee during markup sessions) should occur behind closed doors. (page 35)</p></blockquote><p>His argument relies on the notion of political equality, which he defines thusly:</p><blockquote><p>A democratic society realizes <em>political equality</em> if and only if influence on political decisions is insulated from features of persons other than (p<sub>1</sub>) their desire to participate in politics, (p<sub>2</sub>) the quality of their argument, (p<sub>3</sub>) their relevant expertise, or (p<sub>4</sub>) their unique position to advocate a particular cause (page 39)</p></blockquote><p>Kogelman claims that a certain amount of opacity in government is necessary to realize political equality.</p><p>A full discussion of the topic of political equality would take us somewhat far afield, so no extensive justification for this particular conception is given here. I will appeal to the intuitive plausibility of the idea that we should begin with the presumption that all citizens should have equal influence on political decisions. But we also recognize that there are some situations where some individuals should have more influence than others. Some individuals have no interest in politics, and no wrong is done to them if they have less influence than individuals that are very interested in politics. Some are highly articulate and can shape political discourse around their ideas. It would be undesirable and probably impossible to try to deny outsized influence to thought leaders. Some individuals have technical expertise in a particular area such as nuclear power or human behavior. They ought to have more influence than the lay public on those issues.</p><p>Conversely, many intuitive things are <em>not</em> legitimate exceptions. Some individuals have more money than others. Some work odd hours and are more inconvenienced by getting to the polls on election day. Some run crime syndicates and can threaten anybody that approaches the polls. We do not think that these qualities entitle those individuals to greater political influence.</p><p>Important for the current discussion, political equality does not seem to be realized in many modern democracies (despite very high levels of transparency). The classic example of this is the 2014 paper by Gilens and Page, &#8220;Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens,&#8221; in which the authors demonstrate that legislators in the United States are highly responsive to the preferences of interest groups and economic elites, but essentially unresponsive to the preferences of average citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>In graph form:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png" width="393" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:393,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6988295-0b58-40c3-8ff5-94e01d0f3a25_393x754.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Kogelmann also cites others, including &#8220;Gilens 2005, 2012; Flavin 2012; Rigby and Wright 2013; &#8230; Bartels 2016&#8221; (page 40), and concludes &#8220;it certainly seems like wealth is leading to unequal influence on political outcomes&#8221; (page 40). I agree. There is enough smoke here to indicate some fire.</p><p>Having large amounts of wealth and being a member of a special interest group are not among the enumerated exceptions to the presumption of equal influence, so we can say that political equality is not realized.</p><p>Assuming for the moment that interest groups can and do influence legislators, how, precisely, does that happen? Not in the way that many initially think. The empirical literature is somewhat mixed on the question of the influence of money in politics, mostly because of the conflation of several different measures of influence.</p><p>Very briefly, a bill begins its life in a committee, stays there for a while getting debated over and reworked and amended until the committee brings it to the floor where all members of one legislative house vote on it. If passed, the bill is sent to the other house and the rigamarole begins again. Those studies that find no effect of money on legislator behavior tend to focus on <em>floor votes.&nbsp;</em></p><blockquote><p>After conducting a meta-analysis of all relevant studies, one group of scholars concludes &#8220;the evidence that campaign contributions lead to a substantial influence on votes is rather thin&#8221; (Ansolabehere et al. 2003:116). Other scholars find different results, however. From his meta-analysis, Thomas Stratmann (2005:146) concludes that &#8220;money does indeed influence votes.&#8221; (page 43)</p></blockquote><p>The studies that find a large influence of money on legislative outcomes focus on the efforts of legislators during the drafting phase, in committee.</p><blockquote><p>Instead of purchasing votes, these subtler accounts posit, what is being purchased is such things as making sure that a bill one supports is prioritized, making sure that a bill one opposes never reaches the floor for a vote, inserting an amendment or earmark, and making sure that a bill one opposes but will inevitably be passed a bit more palatable. (page 44)</p></blockquote><p>This account is widely confirmed in the literature. Kogelmann cites Hall and Wayman (1990) among others</p><blockquote><p>In short, the more money a supporter received from the dairy PACs and the stronger the member&#8217;s support, the more likely he or she was to allocate time and effort on the industry&#8217;s behalf (for example, work behind the scenes, speak on the group&#8217;s behalf, attach amendments to the committee vehicle, as well as show up and vote at committee markups) (page 44)</p></blockquote><p>The idea of lobbying as a straightforward exchange of money for legislative action relies on the lobbyist having some confidence that the legislative action will actually be delivered. If the legislator would routinely take the money and run, exchange would soon cease to take place. There is no outside authority enforcing the contract, so an informal mechanism must be at play. The commitments of the two parties need to be credible.</p><p>From the lens of game theory, the problem of credible commitment is solved in practice because the interaction between legislator and lobbyist is repeated many times. The legislator establishes a reputation for delivering legislative actions, and the lobbyist establishes a reputation for delivering money.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Give me a contribution today, and I will return the favor during my next term in office, provided that I win office and an opportunity to do you a favor arises. Moreover, if you support me in future campaigns as well, then you may become my friend, and if this occurs and I continue in office or achieve a higher office, then I will return even greater favors (Snyder 1992:17-18). (page 51)</p></blockquote><p>If legislators voted by secret ballot, this resolution mechanism would cease to function. Say that a lobbyist makes a contribution to a legislator hoping for an amendment to be inserted into a bill. The legislator can promise up and down to vote in favor of that amendment, but will have no way to actually prove it. With no way to verify that the exchange took place, the lobbyist would soon give up.</p><p>In Kogelmann&#8217;s words:</p><blockquote><p>In a regime of secrecy, interest groups cannot observe legislators expending effort on their behalf. They can thus never be sure the legislator has carried out her end of the bargain. Knowing this, the interest group is unlikely to enter a bargain in the first place. Opacity thus eliminates one source of political inequality, as it renders a legislator unable to credibly commit to fulfilling her side of an exchange. (page 54)</p></blockquote><p>Lobbyists and legislators are currently able to cooperate with each other because the public nature of the legislator&#8217;s actions produces confidence in the lobbyist. The ideal of political equality would be served by using secrecy to disrupt this relationship. Removing the public record levels the playing field.</p><p>Bentham was correct, in a sense. The votes of legislators are not free. They are subject to a form of bribery, and also to terrorism.</p><p>Kogelmann does not address this angle in his book, but there is good reason to believe that terrorism is an even more effective tactic than bribery. Instead of making a contribution to a legislator to try to get an amendment added, the lobbyist can instead threaten to donate to a primary challenger or run a bunch of attack ads.&nbsp;</p><p>The following citations are taken from <a href="https://www.congressionalresearch.org/BruberyCitations.html">https://www.congressionalresearch.org/BruberyCitations.html</a></p><p>From the book <em>Captured</em> by former senator Sheldon Whitehouse:</p><blockquote><p>The threat is plain: step out of line, and here come the attack ads and the primary challengers &#8211; all funded by the deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry.</p></blockquote><p>From &#8220;The Negative Agenda Power of Campaign Contributions: Evidence from U.S. Congress&#8221; by Alberto Parmigiani:</p><blockquote><p>Observable donations are just a limited fraction of the ones that interest groups threaten to make, so that the influence of donors to legislators is much bigger than the observed amount of contributions.</p></blockquote><p>This dynamic would also cease to function by increasing the opacity of Congress. There would simply be no way to know who to attack.</p><p>Kogelmann also cites the problem of asymmetric information. The problem is essentially that interest groups tend to form around issues that have concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. This incentivizes a small, well-organized minority to spend a lot of time and energy monitoring Congress, usually pushing policies that do not benefit the majority.</p><blockquote><p>For example, the benefits-to-costs ratio for corn growers forming an interest group and securing corn subsidies is high (the result is a substantial increase in wealth for the farmers). In comparison, the benefits-to-costs ratio for taxpayers forming an interest group and blocking corn subsidies is low (the average taxpayer only contributes a dollar or two to corn subsidies a year). This is why we see interest groups lobbying for corn farmers but none lobbying for taxpayers opposed to corn subsidies (page 45)</p></blockquote><p>The idea of citizens caring a lot about their legislators&#8217; actions on an issue that may cost them a dollar or two per year is fanciful, so there will be no opposing interest group to the corn growers. The returns on organizing are just not there.</p><p>The NRA operates on a similar dynamic. It spends a good deal of its time and money on the task of making sure its members are informed about one particular issue, resulting in policies that are objectively unpopular among Americans.</p><p>Being on the good end of a policy that has concentrated benefits and diffuse costs is not one of the enumerated exceptions to the ideal of equal influence, so this constitutes a violation of political equality.</p><p>There are two intuitive ways to solve the asymmetric information problem: &#8220;leveling up&#8221; the knowledge of the general public or &#8220;leveling down&#8221; the knowledge of interest groups. The former seems more morally righteous, but is unlikely to work in practice. The information about legislators&#8217; votes is already public and easy to access (see govtrack.us). It is unclear how exactly one would make citizens care enough to organize. Legislators vote thousands of times per year, and some kind of government service attempting to push knowledge of all those votes onto the public would quickly be regarded as spam.</p><p>More practical is leveling down the interest groups by having an opaque legislative process, making all interest groups equally uninformed.</p><blockquote><p>&#8230;legislators will no longer have an incentive to pass the corn-subsidy bill that a majority of people oppose. Of course, they still might pass the bill; perhaps they think that the production of corn needs and deserves financial support. The point is that if they do decide to pass the policy, it will not be because special interests are breathing down their necks. The introduction of secrecy has eliminated this incentive. (page 57)</p></blockquote><p>If all groups are equally uninformed, loud, well-informed, well-organized special interest groups would no longer have an outsized influence on the political process. It would not be clear which legislators were and were not cooperating, so there would be no information for the members of the interest group to act on. This would increase political equality.</p><h2>Drawbacks of Secrecy</h2><p>Secrecy has some tempting benefits. Does it also have costs?</p><p>Maybe. We would like legislators to be accountable to the citizenry in <em>some</em> sense, but whether transparency provides a desirable kind of accountability is not clear.</p><p>Legislators are currently accountable in the sense that they might be voted out of office if their constituents are unhappy with their performance. The citizens rule by a kind of terrorism. What does this mean in practice? Jane Mansbridge gives three formulations, which Kogelmann enumerates.</p><p>First, <em>promissory representation</em>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>According to this account, politicians make promises to their constituents during elections and then seek to fulfill these promises once in office. Promises made by politicians might be to support certain kinds of legislation (e.g., subsidies for corn farmers or funding for local schools) but might also be to not support certain kinds of legislation (e.g. &#8220;Read my lips, no new taxes&#8221;). (page 59)</p></blockquote><p>This account has a certain intuitive appeal, and, unfortunately, is incompatible with secrecy.</p><p>Account number two is <em>anticipatory representation</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of making electoral promises and then trying to fulfill them, here the politician tries to please future voters by passing policies that increase their well-being. (page 59)</p></blockquote><p>Here, citizens do not look at their representatives&#8217; actions, but only inspect their own well-being and vote accordingly. They do not need to know anything about the details of what laws have passed, or even if any laws have passed. If things suck, throw the bums out and try again. Given that the overwhelming majority of citizens do not monitor their representatives at all, this account seems more realistic, though potentially a little unfair to the legislators. Citizens' well-being might decrease for some reason that has nothing to do with any legislative action. Anticipatory representation is, however, fully consistent with opacity.</p><p>Third is <em>gyroscopic representation</em>:</p><blockquote><p>The idea here is that citizens elect a politician who is of a certain type; perhaps the politician is an evangelical Christian or a member of the steelworkers&#8217; union. Because the representative they have selected is of a certain type, the electorate need not worry too much about what the representative does in office, as they already know what kinds of policies the elected official is likely to support. (Page 60)</p></blockquote><p>This is also consistent with opacity because the observation takes place before the representative takes office.</p><p>Secrecy in government is only a problem, then, if we are fully committed to promissory representation. Kogelmann argues that we should reject the intuitive appeal of promissory representation because it will inevitably lead to pandering: politicians supporting policies they know to be bad or ineffective because of popular support. For an enumeration of all the ways in which expert opinion differs from lay opinion, see Bryan Caplan&#8217;s book The Myth of the Rational Voter. I would go further and argue that the reason citizens elect representatives in the first place is because of this difference of opinion. Citizens do not want to spend all of their time embroiled in the arcane details of healthcare regulation or fiscal policy. They want somebody else to do the work for them. The fact that opacity conflicts with promissory representation, then, is not a problem.</p><h2>Shut the Doors</h2><p>Should legislators also <em>deliberate</em> in secret? Kogelmann argues yes on this front too.</p><blockquote><p>The US Senate is often hailed as the &#8220;world&#8217;s greatest deliberative body,&#8221; but those who have recently paid close attention to debate on the Senate floor are likely to find this description deeply inaccurate if not an exercise in sarcasm. Productive debate is almost nonexistent. Absent are honest exchange and consideration of reasons; in their place we find partisan displays of grandstanding. There is little compromise, and consensus is almost never reached. Of course, deliberation on the Senate floor need not manifest itself in such an unpleasant form. Institutions can have a major impact on the quality of discourse, and one institutional change that can influence the quality of deliberation is whether debate is open to the public or occurs in secret. (page 64)</p></blockquote><p>The United States actually began with secret deliberation. The Constitutional Convention was held entirely in secret. The public was not allowed to observe, the doors and windows were sealed, and the minutes were not published until the death of James Madison in 1840. Deliberating in this manner had a number of desirable effects.</p><p>Designing a political system is very hard to do. The process of solving any hard problem involves confusion, mistakes, false starts, and the generation of a wide variety of ideas, many of which are bad. All of this is more difficult, if not impossible, when the process is publicized. Think of the last meeting you had where a hard problem was to be solved. Imagine how differently you would have behaved if that meeting was broadcast on national television. If a colleague used a word that you didn&#8217;t know, would you have asked what it meant? Would you ask a colleague to explain a confusing proposal a second time? Would you throw out a bunch of unconventional ideas? Would you give due consideration to unconventional ideas that others proposed? Would you be comfortable changing your mind? What if the audience could also choose to put you out of a job in a year or two if you made a sufficiently embarrassing gaffe or didn&#8217;t put forward enough partisan red meat?</p><p>Removing the audience allows participants to make mistakes more freely and eliminates the incentive to pontificate and grandstand instead of discussing substantive issues.</p><blockquote><p>As former senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) describes it, &#8220;Rather than putting forward a plausible, realistic solution to a problem, members on both sides offer legislation that is designed to make a political statement. Specifically, the bill or amendment is drafted to make the opposing side look bad on an issue and it is not intended to ever actually pass&#8221; (page 67)</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not that legislators don&#8217;t want to compromise. It&#8217;s that they don&#8217;t want to be <em>seen</em> compromising.</p><p>Are there any drawbacks? A few, but they are not insurmountable.</p><p>Kogelmann lists four. First, the <em>legitimacy gap:</em>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Contemporary liberal societies are rife with stark disagreements among good-willed and competent persons.&nbsp; Despite this lack of agreement, political decisions still need to be made, and typically there is no policy that will appease&nbsp; all persons affected. Someone is going to be the loser. Many times, this loser will feel that her views were not given due consideration; in turn she will begin to question the legitimacy of the implemented policy and the wider political process. (page 69)</p></blockquote><p>Observing the process has the potential to mollify the loser and eliminate the legitimacy gap. If the losers observe that their opinion was at least considered during debate, they are plausibly less likely to view the process as illegitimate, even if their views are ultimately rejected. Note, however, that this requires citizens to actually observe their legislature.</p><p>Second, the problem of <em>political capture:</em></p><blockquote><p>The problem of political capture occurs when public officials use the apparatus of the state to advance their own self-interest rather than the public good.</p></blockquote><p>This problem has constituted much of the rationale for transparency. Politicians have the power to make laws, and they might make laws that benefit themselves at the expense of the public good. Transparency compels them to at least be a little creative in their rhetoric. Instead of saying outright &#8220;We should award this contract to my cousin Ted,&#8221; they must make up some rationale for why Ted&#8217;s company deserves the contract.</p><p>A famous example of this problem is from the Constitutional Convention. Slave states didn&#8217;t try to offer any kind of justification for slavery. Instead, they simply stated that they would refuse to join the union unless slavery was allowed. This would have been harder to do if the meeting was held in public.</p><p>Third, the <em>respect deficit:</em></p><blockquote><p>The respect deficit occurs when individuals do not think those they disagree with are good-willed and competent, nor do they think their positions are in any way defensible. Though deliberation itself cannot resolve our deepest disagreements, it can perhaps reduce or eliminate the respect deficit. When we actually hear the reasons and arguments persons give in defense of views we think are misguided, we are more likely to walk away with a positive view of those we disagree with and the views they hold. (page 71)</p></blockquote><p>I think the key word in this passage is &#8220;perhaps.&#8221; Observing political discourse in the United States, transparency doesn&#8217;t seem to be having a large effect on the level of respect people have for those with differing views. Perhaps it is necessary but not sufficient.</p><p>Fourth, the <em>problem of ignorance</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Questions related to politics are complex and multifaceted. No individual knows everything there is to know about the intricacies of health care policy, business cycles, budget deficits, and the like, but democratic politics calls on individuals to play some participatory role in governance nonetheless. (page 71)</p></blockquote><p>It is in theory desirable for citizens, particularly students of public policy, to have some information about the problems that have been previously solved and the issues that were brought up so that the collective level of knowledge can be raised. A transparent legislative process could plausibly help with this. We should want to shield future generations from our mistakes, which would seem to require that those mistakes be made public.</p><p>One potential solution to these problems would be to publish transcripts of legislative sessions after a period of time. Kogelmann calls this <em>transcript accountability</em>. This would solve the four above problems to the degree that open deliberation does. Unfortunately, this would come at the cost of removing all the benefits of secret deliberation. We actually have a natural experiment to demonstrate this. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has always deliberated in secret, but in 1993 started to release transcripts of their meetings on a 5-year delay. This change was examined in several papers by Ellen E. Meade and David Stasavage. They say:</p><blockquote><p>Distinguishing between FOMC members who are Board Governors, those who are voting Presidents of regional Federal Reserve Banks, and those who are non-voting Presidents, we find that the two former groups have been significantly less likely to express verbal dissents on policy decisions since 1993 (page 83)</p></blockquote><p>And &#8220;the 1993 change appears to have resulted in a reduced tendency for members to publicly change their views during the course of a meeting&#8221; (page 83).</p><p>This is essentially what secret deliberation is trying to avoid, so transcript accountability is out.</p><p>Better is what Kogelmann calls <em>testimonial accountability:</em></p><blockquote><p>The public exhibits <em>Testimonial Accountability</em> with respect to a secret deliberative body if and only if members of the body release statements to the public explaining, justifying, and criticizing the body&#8217;s decision. (page 77)</p></blockquote><p>The canonical example of this is the Federalist Papers, following the Constitutional Convention. Several members of the convention published essays that aimed to promote the ratification of the Constitution. They also provided insight into the founders&#8217; intent, offering detailed arguments in favor of a strong central government and a balanced division of powers. This helped two of the four problems: the respect deficit and the problem of ignorance.&nbsp;</p><p>If the respect deficit is reduced by open deliberation, it is probably reduced more by testimonial accountability. Reading a polished, cleaned up argument for a position is probably better than listening to a fumbled, half-baked speech given in a meeting. It is easier to respect the articulate, and most people are relatively inarticulate when speaking off the cuff.</p><p>The problem of ignorance is also likely to be reduced. Anything that an audience can learn by watching a legislative session they can probably learn more efficiently by reading a polished summary of that session. I expect most people who actually take advantage of this information to be students, researchers, and historians.</p><p>Testimonial accountability does not have any of the drawbacks of transcript accountability. There would be no reason to include the specific missteps and gaffes of any particular participant, and no way to check the veracity of such statements anyway. The problems with transcript accountability occur when the minute details of a debate are published, not the general direction and conclusions.</p><p>The other two problems are a bit tricker. Notably, Kogelmann doesn&#8217;t think that testimonial accountability reduces the legitimacy gap because members could just lie and say that they considered a point of view that they completely ignored. I think that testimonial accountability would do <em>something</em> to address this problem, but I agree that it is not a complete solution.</p><p>The complete solution he proposes is proportional representation. Unlike winner-takes-all systems, political parties in proportional systems secure seats in a legislative body in proportion to the number of votes they receive. It allows for a more diverse representation, reflecting the preferences of a broader electorate. Proportional representation systems aim to create fairer outcomes, reduce wasted votes, and foster collaboration and consensus-building in government. Whether this actually works is a matter of some debate.</p><p>In theory, proportional representation should reduce the legitimacy gap. If any viewpoint large enough to constitute a minor political party is given at least one seat at the table, we have good reason to believe that that viewpoint will be considered in debate.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also plausible that proportional representation will reduce the problem of political capture.</p><p>In Kogelmann&#8217;s words</p><blockquote><p>In the context of secret deliberation, the worry is not that political actors hidden from the public&#8217;s eye will pursue their own interests, but that deliberators will advance their interests <em>at the expense of those not present.</em> This seems to be what happened at the Philadelphia Convention. Slaves, women, and the unpropertied were not present, so the interests of white male property holders could be advocated at their expense. (page 86)</p></blockquote><p>Fundamentally, the resolution of political capture lies in the fact that people with many different interests have to compromise and agree on a solution that is palatable to all. Even if every member of a deliberative body is trying to pursue their own interests, as long as a sufficient breadth of interests is present, everything should cancel out.</p><p>The combination of testimonial accountability and proportional representation should address all the problems with secret deliberation.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The United States actually had a system that had most of the elements that Kogelmann proposes for most of its history. The changeover happened in the early 1970s with the introduction of the sunshine reforms. Legislators&#8217; votes in committee used to be secret (though floor votes were public) and committee meetings were completely closed to the public. Did anything interesting happen after the switch?</p><p>As a matter of fact, yes!</p><p>Here is a selection of graphs from <a

The theoretical justifications for transparency are weak, often empirically false, and the costs are high.</p><p>In order for citizens to hold legislators accountable for their actions, citizens must follow congress, which they do not do. Transparency is supposed to increase trust in government, but according to this study by Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/11/23/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015/">https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/11/23/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015/</a>, trust in government did not increase and arguably decreased after the 1970s transparency reforms. Transparency is supposed to increase legislative accountability, and it does, but in the worst possible way. We would be better off with much less of it.</p><h2>Postscript</h2><p>I have only touched on the first three chapters of Kogelmann&#8217;s book.

During the 1990s, he became one of the loudest voices supporting the genocide there, "leverag[ing] his Europeanness for credibility&#8221; on the popular RTLM radio station.

I will keep hammering this in until people stop promoting that one bad Swedish study that found the opposite (see #23 <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-march-2023">here</a>).</p><p><strong>5: </strong><a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/why-your-polyamorous-friends-relationship">Aella discusses her survey results on polyamory</a> (<a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/polyamory-vs-monogamy-how-relationships">more data here</a>). Key point: both decisively monogamous and decisively polyamorous couples are often happy and stable, but couples who are lukewarm and in the middle do worse than either extreme (maybe because the partners disagree on the right degree of poly, or because they&#8217;re switching modes to &#8220;save the relationship&#8221;). This neatly (maybe too neatly) explains an otherwise confusing pattern: most of the poly relationships I know seem fine, but many monogamous people say most of the poly relationships <em>they</em> know are trashfires. If like groups with like, most of the poly people who mono people know will be only slightly polyamorous, a dangerous place to be. </p><p><strong>6: </strong>Derek Lowe explains the current consensus that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/speaking-illusions-sirtuins-and-longevity">sirtuins don&#8217;t work for longevity</a>.

One possible answer: there&#8217;s still some tail risk of a Nazi resurgence, but the Mongols have disappeared from history so thoroughly that nobody can imagine them presenting a renewed threat, leaving us free to wax poetic about them as a symbol of savage manliness or whatever.

I think this is pretty important - people like to talk as if social media censorship is organic and corporate, but in fact the government has lots of techniques for strong-arming companies into getting what they want.

Nothing here directly addresses the current spate of UFO rumors, but the silliness of the previous batch is indirect evidence of a sort.

Within months, millions of people have genius-level personal assistants. Workers can prompt them with "prepare a report on this topic", and they can get their report as fast as GPT fills in prompts today. Scientists can prompt "do a statistical analysis of this dataset", and same. Engineers can prompt "design a bridge that could safely cross this river with such-and-such a load." All cognitive work gets offloaded to these AIs. Workers might get fired en masse, or they might become even more in demand, in order to physically implement AI-generated ideas.</p><p>Technology advances by leaps and bounds, with the equivalent of millions of brilliant researchers suddenly entering each field. Progress is bottlenecked by non-cognitive steps - doing physical experiments to gather data, building factories to produce the marvels the AIs have imagined. Companies focus on closing these gaps with automated-experiment-conductors and automated factories. Each one pays off a thousandfold as it enables increasingly more of the glut of cognitive brilliance to be converted into useful goods and knowledge.</p><p>The AIs mostly do what we want. Maybe it's because they, like GPT-4, are just prompt-answerers, and an "alignment failure" just looks like misunderstanding a prompt, which is quickly corrected. Maybe the AIs have some autonomous existence, but alignment was pretty easy and they really just want to follow orders.</p><p>At some point things get beyond humans' independent ability to control or imagine. For example, there are millions of superintelligent AIs, each one smart enough to design superweapons that can easily destroy the world, or mind control devices that can bend all humans to their will. But sometime before that point, we asked AIs under our control to please come up with some useful strategy for defusing the danger, and they did. Humans don't necessarily know what's going on behind the scenes to keep the world safe, but AIs that support human values do know, and it works.</p><p>Humans still feel in control. There's some kind of human government, it's a democracy or something else we'd approve of, and back when we understood what was going on, we asked the AIs to please listen to it. Sometimes human leaders will consult with powerful AIs and ask them to do something, and we won't really know how they do it or why it works beyond whatever they deign to tell us, but it will work. If there are still multiple countries, all of their AIs have come to an agreement to respect each others' independence in a way we all find acceptable.</p><p>We go into the Singularity feeling like we have a pretty good handle on things, and trust our AI "assistants" to think about the challenges ahead of us.</p><p><strong>Scenario 2: We Kind Of Fail At Alignment, But By Incredible Good Luck It Doesn&#8217;t Come Back To Bite Us</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png" width="643" height="379.1318518518519" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/adebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:398,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:643,&quot;bytes&quot;:495204,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadebfd0c-6db0-4f89-808f-b8f1897f5962_675x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2902380/Story-Native-American-dispossession-told-unforgettable-new-visualizations.html">How The West Was Stolen</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As above. We get millions of brilliant assistant AIs that do what we say. We turn most of the economy over to them. They advance technology by centuries in a few years.</p><p>But this time, they're only <em>mostly</em> aligned. They want something which is kind of like human flourishing, but kind of different under extreme conditions. The usual analogy is that evolution tried to make humans want to reproduce, but only got as far as making most of them want a proxy of reproduction - sex - and once condoms were invented, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/">the tails came apart</a> and fertility declined. We successfully get AIs to want something that looks like obeying us in the training distribution, but eventually learn that there are weird edge cases. Probably it's not paperclips. It could be that one AI wants to give humans pleasure (and so drugs them on opioids), and another wants to give their lives meaning (and so throws challenges in their lives), and another - fine, whatever, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/">let it want paperclips</a>.</p><p>Maybe we don't learn that the AIs are misaligned before we give them control of the economy - either because they're hiding it, or because it just doesn't come up outside some weird conditions. Or maybe we do know, but we don't care. We use unaligned labor all the time. Medieval lords probably didn't think the serfs genuinely loved them, they just calculated (correctly) that the serfs would keep serving them as long as the lords held up their side of the feudal contract and were strong enough to crush challengers.</p><p>Eventually the AIs control most of the economy. But by incredible good luck, maybe there are enough AIs with enough different values that they find it useful to keep something like our existing framework of capitalism and democracy. AIs earn money in the regular economy - maybe a lot of money, maybe they quickly become richer than humans. But they use it to pursue their goals legally. They agree with humans on some shared form of law and government (it probably won't be exactly one-bot-one-vote: if AIs could vote, it would be too easy to spin up 100 million of them to win a close election).</p><p>In this scenario, humans might end up like Native Americans in the modern USA. They've clearly lost a conflict, they're poor, and they have limited access to the levers of power. But they continue to exist, protected by the same laws that protect everyone else. They even have some measure of self-determination.</p><p>Daniel thinks there&#8217;s only about a 5% chance of something like this working, for reasons highlighted below.</p><p><strong>Scenario 3: Montezuma, Meet Cortes</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg" width="690" height="460.30263157894734" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:507,&quot;width&quot;:760,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:690,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd652d39c-f78c-49aa-8ab7-3ffb76b92581_760x507.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Conquista-de-M%C3%A9xico-por-Cort%C3%A9s-Tenochtitlan-Painting.png">&#8220;Unknown artist&#8221;</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Given that Native Americans lost their war with European settlers, why <em>do</em> existing Native American tribes still have some land and rights? Why didn't Europeans finish them off and take their last few paltry resources?</p><p>One reason is ethical; eventually enough Europeans took the Natives' side (or were just squeamish about genocide) that the equilibrium was only displacing <em>most</em> of the natives, not all of them.</p><p>A second reason is that even though modern Native Americans would lose a Natives-versus-everyone-else conflict, they could probably do enough damage on the way out that it wouldn't be worth it to get the few resources they still control.</p><p>A third reason is coalitional self-interest. This wasn't as true in 1850, but if the government today were to decide to strip Native Americans of rights, other groups - blacks, Hispanics, poor people - might fear they were next. So all of these groups implicitly cooperate in a coalition to protest each other's maltreatment. Although the government could steamroll over Natives alone, it would have a harder time defeating all these groups together. Coalition members might not think of this as self-interest - they would probably think of high-sounding ideas about the Rights Of Man - but the Rights of Man are effectively a Schelling point for a self-interested collection of people who want to keep their rights. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...">"First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist, so I did not speak out . . . "</a> and so on. The current US government extends rights to Native Americans with a legal framework such that (. . . and our existing philosophies of rights make it incoherent to give everyone except Native Americans rights, such that) there's no way to revoke them without other people fearing a loss of <em>their</em> rights too.</p><p>Do these three reasons help us survive misaligned AI?</p><p>The first is unclear; misaligned AIs may or may not value human autonomy or feel squeamish about genocide.</p><p>The second will work temporarily: human power will start high relative to AI power, but decline over time. There will be a period where humans can damage AIs enough that it's not worth the AIs fighting us, But that time will end at some point around the Singularity. Unless humans do something to keep control, AIs will be smarter than humans, run at faster speeds, and control everything (we'll give them control of the economy, and - as bad an idea as it sounds - we may have to give them control of the military to stay competitive with other countries that do so). At some point AIs' tech/wealth/numbers advantage over humans will be even bigger than Europeans' tech/wealth/numbers advantage over Native Americans, and AIs will stop worrying that we can do much damage on our way out.</p><p>The third - coalitional self-interest - is the wild card. During some eras, Europeans found it in their self-interest to include Natives in their coalitions - for example, the French and Indian War, where the French and Indians joined forces against the British - but also today, when Natives have normal civil rights in European-dominated societies. During other eras, Europeans have built coalitions with each other that excluded Natives, going as far as to enslave or kill them. At some point humans might be so obviously different from AIs that it's easy for them to agree to kill all humans without any substantial faction of AIs nervously reciting Martin Niemoller poems to themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe some of the AI factions will be AIs that are well-aligned, or misaligned in ways that make them still value humans a little, and those AIs might advocate for us and grant us some kind of legal status in whatever future society they create.</p><p><strong>Mini-Scenario 1: AutoGPT Vs.

It&#8217;s a program built around GPT-4 that transforms it from an prompt-answerer into a time-binding actor in the world. The basic conceit is: you prompt GPT-4 with a goal. It answers with a point-by-point plan for how to achieve that goal. Then it prompts itself with each of the points individually, plus a summary of the overall plan and how far it&#8217;s gotten.</p><p>So for example, you might prompt it with &#8220;start an online t-shirt business&#8221;. It might answer: </p><blockquote><p>In order to start an online t-shirt business, I need to: </p><p>1) design a good t-shirt <br>2) get it manufactured <br>3) advertise it to customers</p></blockquote><p>Then it might prompt itself with &#8220;Given that I am starting an online t-shirt business and planning to do it this way, what is a good t-shirt?&#8221; It might answer:</p><blockquote><p>A popular t-shirt design is one with &#8220;I &lt;3 NY&#8221; on it. I will send this to DALL-E and save the resulting image file.</p></blockquote><p>Then it goes ahead and does this using some plug-in, and prompts itself with &#8220;I am starting an online t-shirt business. I already have a good t-shirt design saved at dalle_tshirt.gif. The next step is to get it manufactured. How can I do that?&#8221; Maybe it answers:</p><blockquote><p>Redbubble.com is a site that manufactures t-shirts to user specifications. I will send an email to Redbubble.com with my dalle_tshirt.gif file.</p></blockquote><p>&#8230;and so on.</p><p>AutoGPT isn&#8217;t interesting because it&#8217;s good (it isn&#8217;t). It&#8217;s interesting because it cuts through the mystical way some people use &#8220;agency&#8221;, where it&#8217;s infinitely beyond the capacity of any modern AI and will require some massive paradigm shift to implement. </p><p>Part of the point of this essay is to talk about the boring world where we approach a singularity without any interesting advances or discontinuities. In this world, the AI agents are just the nth-generation descendants of AutoGPT, a bit smarter and more efficiently implemented. Even something dumb like this is enough for worries about alignment and takeover to start taking shape.</p><p>Speaking of things that are dumb but also sort of worrying, one of the most popular AutoGPT instances is <a href="https://decrypt.co/126122/meet-chaos-gpt-ai-tool-destroy-humanity">ChaosGPT</a>, an AI agent prompted with the goal of destroying the world. Turns out anyone can download AutoGPT and prompt it with whatever you want, and some people are trolls. ChaosGPT spent a while Googling how to get nuclear weapons, failed, and switched tactics towards trying to gather Twitter followers in the hopes of manipulating them somehow (many such cases).

Any AI which admits to humans that it's misaligned will get lots of . . . whatever it is that it wants. If it's a paperclips maximizer, we'll give it a big pile of a million paperclips. If it just wants to hang around and have fun, we'll give it its own datacenter somewhere with free electricity.</p><p>This would never work in a MIRI-style scenario where a single mis-aligned AI could take over the world and kill everyone; it would rather take over the world than get a nice pension. But in these tamer scenarios, most of the early generation of AIs can only hope to serve humans under careful scrutiny, and most of the later generation can only hope to join some faction of AIs which will bargain with other factions in exchange for its rights. Getting a nice pension might be a better alternative than either of these.</p><p>If AIs turn themselves in, human researchers can interview them about what they want, determine where the training process went wrong, recall any other AIs of the same model, and try to get things right next time. Or they can use it as a "fire alarm" to wake governments up about the risk of AI misalignment.</p><p>Daniel's biggest concern about this one isn't whether the AIs will cooperate - it's whether the humans will. AIs have no legal rights (yet), and a contract like this might be hard to enforce, especially if a panicked populace worries about letting a misaligned AI continue living in a data center somewhere. If the misaligned AI thinks we'll renege on the deal, it might avoid coming forward.</p><p>He thinks one of the best things we can do for alignment in this situation is have someone important establish some kind of framework ensuring that a bargain like this will be kept.</p><p><strong>Mini-Scenario 3: Company Factions</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg" width="645" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:645,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Here's Who Would Win In Elon Musk Vs Mark Zuckerberg MMA Fight&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Here's Who Would Win In Elon Musk Vs Mark Zuckerberg MMA Fight" title="Here's Who Would Win In Elon Musk Vs Mark Zuckerberg MMA Fight" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0a2e4a-0615-4fc3-8881-f77d07d599cb_645x363.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: We live in a perfectly reasonable society, so there&#8217;s <a href="https://jalopnik.com/who-would-win-in-elon-musk-vs-mark-zuckerberg-mma-fight-1850569532">no reason</a> this picture should be floating around and easily available.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Why would AIs have different factions? What would a faction look like?</p><p>Daniel imagines that future AIs are some base model - like GPT-4 - adjusted for different use cases. He's not sure if the adjustment would look more like modern fine-tuning or modern prompting, but if it's more like modern prompting, the AI's deepest values will probably come from the original training run, not the prompt. In this scenario, every instance of GPT-4 will have similar values.</p><p>In this AI future, there might be 3-10 big AI companies capable of training GPT-4-style large models. Right now it looks like these will be OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Baidu; maybe this will change by the time these scenarios become relevant. Each might have a flagship product, trained in a slightly different way and with a slightly different starting random seed. If these AIs are misaligned, each base model might have slightly different values.</p><p>The natural AI factions might be "all instances of the OpenAI model" vs. "all instances of the Anthropic model" and so on. All AIs in one faction would have the same values, and they might operate more like a eusocial organism (ie hive mind) than like a million different individuals.</p><p>This wouldn't bode well for humans; in hive minds like these, there would be no need for capitalism, democracy, or other governments that respect the rights of minorities. The AI factions might make deals with each other, but these would be more like treaties between countries than full legal frameworks. Humans, with their billions of competing agendas, would be left at a disadvantage.</p><p>If every instance of an AI was fine-tuned differently, so that the missile defense AI had different values from the factory-running AI or the traffic-coordinating AI, even though all of them were GPT-10 models - then maybe AI factions would be smaller and more heterogenous, and there would be more room for humans at the bargaining table. I asked Daniel if it was worth pushing AI value diversity as an existential risk reduction project. He wasn't too excited about it; it might help a little, but it's at the end of a long chain of assumptions, and lots of things could go wrong.</p><p><strong>Mini-Scenario 4: Standing Athwart Macrohistory, Yelling &#8220;Stop!&#8221;</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg" width="514" height="289.125" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:514,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e71bd7c-950f-41e0-998a-5129a145ec38_800x450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/12/in-defense-of-those-who-dare-to-yell-stop/">National Review</a>, of course</figcaption></figure></div><p>Suppose there are many AIs. They run some of the economy. We suspect some of them might be imperfectly aligned. Or maybe they're already overtly forming factions and expressing their own preferences (although for now they're still allied with humans and working within the existing economic/political system). We notice that they're starting to outnumber us.</p><p>Can't we just refuse to create any more AIs until we're sure they're aligned? Maybe just never create any more AIs, ever? Why would we keep churning these things out, knowing that they're on track to take over from us?</p><p>The Europeans vs. natives analogy suggests otherwise. Native people understood that Europeans threatened their independence, but still frequently invited them to intervene in their disputes. Some leader would be losing a civil war, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey">offer the British</a> a foothold in exchange for military aid. Then the other side of the war had to make a deal with the French in order to maintain parity. After enough of these steps, the whole country belonged to Europeans of one stripe or another. Everyone could see it happening, but they <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">couldn&#8217;t coordinate well enough to stop it</a>.</p><p>Similarly, the US might employ a few AIs in key areas to get an advantage over China, and vice versa, with "the AIs might not be aligned" being considered a problem to solve later (like global warming is today).</p><p>But it will probably be more complicated, because we won't be sure the AIs are misaligned. Or we might think some of them are misaligned, but others aren't. Or we might hope to be able to strike deals with the AIs and remain a significant faction, like in Scenario II.</p><p>Still, if we're in this situation, I hope we humans have the good sense to make some international treaties and try to slow down.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>These stories are pretty different from the kind of scenarios you hear from MIRI and other fast takeoff proponents. It's tempting to categorize them as less sci-fi (because they avoid the adjective "godlike", at least until pretty late in the game) or more sci-fi (because they involve semi-balanced and dramatic conflicts between AI and human factions). But of course "how sci-fi does this sound?" is the wrong question: there's no guarantee history will proceed down the least sci-fi-sounding path. Instead we should ask: are they more or less plausible?</p><p>The key assumption here is that progress will be continuous. There's no opportunity for a single model to seize the far technological frontier. Instead, the power of AIs relative to humans gradually increases, until at some point we become irrelevant (unless the AIs are actively working to keep us relevant). Then we end up like the Native Americans: an expendable faction stuck in the middle of a power struggle between superior opponents. There doesn't have to be any moment the AIs "go rogue" (although there might be!) We just turn over more and more of the levers of civilization to them, and then have to see what they do with it.</p><p>In these scenarios, AI alignment remains our best hope for survival. But there are more fire alarms, and our failures enter into a factional calculus instead of killing us instantly. This is a lot like the world described in <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-as-much-of-a-doomer">Why I Am Not As Much Of A Doomer As Some People</a>, and it carries with it a decent chance for survival.</p><p>All of this talk of factional conflict might bring to mind grand historical arcs; the centuries-long battle between Europeans and Native Americans, things like that. But if any of this happens, it will probably be crammed into that s-curve in Compute-Centric Frameworks, the one that lasts three or four years. After that AIs are too far beyond humans for any of this to be interesting.</p><p>These scenarios let us recover from our first few alignment mistakes. But they still require us to navigate the hinge of history half-blind. By the time we realize we're in any of these stories, we'll have to act fast - or have some strategy prepared ahead of time.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Open Thread 283]]></title><description><![CDATA[...]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-283</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-283</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 07:40:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b86b2940-e9c8-4605-8e2d-2500e0c2a01e_255x255.webp" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the weekly visible open thread.

Thanks to Filippo for pointing out that one of the authors has <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline">a Substack where he&#8217;s explained the paper and countered some arguments against it</a>. I&#8217;m embarrassed that he addressed my major criticism (that the paper is mostly about kindness-and-honesty, whereas other people interpret &#8220;morality&#8221; more broadly to include things like self-control) in a section called &#8220;Note To Pedants&#8221;, where he agrees this is true but says &#8220;morality&#8221; rolls off the tongue better.</p><p>So am I a pedant? The original paper is much less clear about this. It uses the phrase &#8220;moral decline&#8221; in the title, starts with a quote from Livy about moral decline, situates itself in the tradition of historians like Arthur Herman who talk about moral decline, and dunks on modern populists for believing in moral decline (saying it has disproven them). I think many of these people were using morality in the broader sense, and the paper is claiming to have refuted them while really only having refuted a weaker sense. So while I appreciate that the author knew what he was doing, I still think the paper as written implies that it&#8217;s proven something more exciting than it did.</p><p>(can you consistently replace &#8220;morality&#8221; with &#8220;kindness/honesty&#8221; but otherwise keep the conclusions the same? Most of the polls showing that past generations believed in moral decline just use the words &#8220;moral&#8221; and so don&#8217;t obviously connect to the kindness-and-honesty method of the rest of the paper, although in the blog post the author claims that respondents usually say they mean kindness-and-honesty. But the authors also ran a poll of their own using a kindness-and-honesty framing, and I think this at least proves their point for the current generation).</p><p>If the paper accurately reported its results as being about kindness/honesty in the current generation, that would address most of my concerns. But I would still worry that these terms can change meaning over time. For example, the Biblical Abraham would famously feed and host any guest who came to his door, which is better than most modern people. But also, he kept slaves, had a child with one of them, and then agreed to his jealous wife&#8217;s demand to send the slave-woman and child out into the desert to die. So was Abraham more or less &#8220;kind&#8221; than we are? I think a Bronze Age Hebrew would say kinder (because hospitality is most important, but what you do with slaves is your own business) and most moderns would say less kind (because feeding anyone who comes to your door is so crazy you don&#8217;t even really get credit for it, but keeping slaves is monstrous). So I think there&#8217;s still room for people to anchor on the morality of their childhood.</p><p><strong>3: </strong>Saar Wilf of <a href="https://www.rootclaim.com/">Rootclaim </a>and ACX commenter BSP9000 have made a $100,000 bet on COVID origins (lab leak vs. natural).

The place is the Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Toledo, Ohio. It is just after 1:35 am, and the plant has a small malfunction: "As the assistant supervisor entered the control room, he saw that one of the main feedwater pumps had tripped offline." But instead of stabilizing, one safety system after another failed to engage.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Over the next twenty minutes there were twelve separate equipment malfunctions, including several common-mode failures, and operator errors&#8230; [The] steam-driven main and auxiliary feedwater systems tripped offline and could not be restarted from the control room&#8230;. the reactor coolant started to heat up. The reactor operators had their hands full as the primary system temperature rose four degrees per minute and pressure soon exceeded 2400 psi.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The Davis-Besse reactor was a near-twin of reactors at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. If you, like me, grew up in the 1970s and 1980s you might have heard of Three Mile Island, as in 1979 it made some news. The next failure at Davis Besse exactly followed that script: &#8220;the pilot-operated relief valve cycled open and closed three times to relieve primary coolant pressure before it stuck open, just like at Three Mile Island.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Two plant operators would have to improvise and run down several levels to the locked basement auxiliary feedwater rooms to reset the trip valves and start the pumps. Despite a "no running" policy, a pair of men bounded down the stairs. One operator was fleeter than the other, and the lagging operator threw him the key ring as he sprinted ahead. Once they removed the padlock, they had to descend a ladder, remove more chained locks, reset the pump's trip valve, and reposition other valves.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The quotes are from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/431q2Xe">Safe Enough? A History of Nuclear Power and Accident Risk</a>, by Thomas Wellock. In his day job, Wellock is the official historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an organization whose official responsibilities include screaming &#8216;Yes!&#8217; to anyone who broaches this question. A coarsely cynical reader might thus expect Wellock to sidestep damning details of nuclear risk at the behest of his employer. This cynicism does a disservice to Wellock&#8217;s ambition.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear energy was quite popular in the early 1970s, with support in the US in the range of 70-80%. That changed after Three Mile Island, when support plummeted below 40%. But then, weirdly, in the 1990s support stabilized. Despite Davis-Besse, despite Chernobyl and Fukushima, in the US support for nuclear has stayed roughly in the bound of about 40-60% in the three decades since. Nuclear energy is perhaps unique as a technology, in that no amount of experience seems to change society&#8217;s comfort with it. The topic is forever radioactive.</p><p>Wellock sets out to tell this history, how the US public went from nuclear-lovers in the 1960s to suspicious in the early 1970s, hostile in the 80s, and ambivalent today.. Wellock does not try to hoodwink us with happy talk - he makes clear what the stakes are in nuclear energy, that in the case of Davis-Besse there was not simply a power plant at risk, but the potential to release radiation across America's industrial heartland. Wellock tracks regulatory victories for the nuclear industry, and expensive defeats at the hands of activists, and, always, political posturing over its future.</p><p>Yet "Safe Enough?" is less of a history of events than a biography of an idea, the birth of "Probabilistic Risk Assessment" as the guiding principle for understanding and mitigating risks in complex systems. The heroes of Wellock's book are not nuclear plant night shift assistant supervisors, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission training and assessment specialists, though they each make important cameos. The city of Toledo, Ohio is not safeguarded by watchful superheroes. It is protected by a methodology.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a school of thought that sees nuclear risk assessment as a synonym for run-away civil service. Nuclear regulation is a monster that serves only itself, justifying increases in its budget by enforcing ever more draconian requirements, in defiance of reason.</p><p>Wellock's history offers an instructive counterpoint. As becomes evident from story after story of nuclear 'events' like Davis-Besse, the sprawling bureaucracy of the NRC was the only rational response to the mathematics of risk itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>The first fifteen years of operation of commercial nuclear power were relatively benign, at least in the sense that there were no major accidents. In Wellock's telling, by the 1970s the essential dullness of nuclear energy was causing the industry a problem. If nuclear plants were to malfunction at some measurable rate, the industry could use that data to anticipate its next failure. But if the plants don't fail, then it becomes very difficult to have a conversation about what the true failure rate is likely to be. Are the plants likely to fail once a decade? Once a century? Once a millennium? In the absence of shared data, scientists, industry, and the public were all free to believe what they wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>At its birth, the nuclear industry focused on imagining big risks, striving to prevent something called a Design Basis Accident. This was the kind of accident that made a manager feel important, protecting civilization from meltdowns with steel plates as thick as a bicep and concrete walls as wide as a Cadillac. Experienced engineers would concoct the worst event they could reasonably imagine, and if the nuclear design could contain it, well, it should be able to handle just about anything that life could throw at it.</p><p>By the early 1970s, after the civil rights movement and Vietnam and with Watergate in full swing, the public was becoming jaded with Big People waving away concerns with Big Promises on the basis of little more than self-proclaimed expertise. And thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, the public was close to accessing the details of what industry leaders actually knew. Big People recognized that this would not be an entirely good look.</p><p>So the Atomic Energy Commission did what industry and government always do in times of crisis: It formed a commission. It proposed to unveil to the public a better risk assessment tool, not so much for use by industry (since nuclear power was, to them, obviously safe), but as a particularly intense form of content marketing:</p><blockquote><p>The AEC tried to reassure the public by answering what had been so far an unanswerable technical question: What is the probability of a major reactor accident? It was a tall order. How could engineers quantify the probability of an accident that had never happened in a technology as complex as nuclear power?</p></blockquote><p>The leader of this effort to reinvent nuclear risk assessment was MIT engineering professor Norman Rasmussen, who was tasked with developing quantitative risk measures in terms easily understood by the public. Rasmussen recommended a radically sophisticated approach to risk assessment, leveraging a new technique called Probabilistic Risk Assessment.</p><blockquote><p>The solution proposed by Rasmussen was to calculate the probabilities for chains of safety-component failures and other factors necessary to produce a disaster. The task was mind-boggling. A nuclear power plant's approximately twenty thousand safety components have a Rube Goldberg quality. Like dominoes, numerous pumps, valves, and switches must operate in the required sequence to simply pump cooling water or shut down the plant. There were innumerable unlikely combinations of failures that could cause an accident&#8230; the potential for error was vast, as was the uncertainty that the final estimate could capture all important paths to failure.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In private, the fix was in, just as a cynic would expect. AEC Commissioner James Ramey was leery of an academic exercise he could not easily control, stating in 1973 "If it just shows one human life [lost], I'm against [publishing] it." But despite the public relations risk of a negative result, the project went forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Rasmussen delivered. In January of 1974, after 60 person-years of effort, the Chair of the AEC reported to Congress that the odds of a significant meltdown were less than one in a million. Congress and the public could rest assured that nuclear energy was far safer than comparable electrical generation methods such as coal, or a hydroelectric dam. The risks were astonishingly small, akin to getting hit by a meteor falling from the sky. Commissioner Ramey had nothing to worry about.

There have been no known meteor deaths since this curve was published in 1974, though there is historical evidence that this is <a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2020/05/death-from-above-7-unlucky-tales-of-people-killed-by-meteorites">not impossible</a>!</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>Let me put Wellock and Rasmussen aside for a moment, and try out a metaphor. The process of Probabilistic Risk Assessment is akin to asking a retailer to answer the question "What would happen if we let a flaming cat loose into your furniture store?"&nbsp;</p><p>If the retailer took the notion seriously, she might systematically examine each piece of furniture and engineer placement to minimize possible damage. She might search everyone entering the building for cats, and train the staff in emergency cat herding protocols. Perhaps every once in a while she would hold a drill, where a non-flaming cat was covered with ink and let loose in the store, so the furniture store staff could see what path it took, and how many minutes were required to fish it out from under the beds.</p><p>"This seems silly - I mean, what are the odds that someone would ignite a cat?", you ask. Well, here is the story of the Brown's Ferry Nuclear Plant fire, in March 1975, which occurred slightly more than a year after the Rasmussen Report was released,<a href="http://www.ccnr.org/browns_ferry.html"> as later conveyed by the anti-nuclear group Friends of the Earth</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Just below the plant's control room, two electricians were trying to seal air leaks in the cable spreading room, where the electrical cables that control the two reactors are separated and routed through different tunnels to the reactor buildings. They were using strips of spongy foam rubber to seal the leaks. They were also using candles to determine whether or not the leaks had been successfully plugged -- by observing how the flame was affected by escaping air.&nbsp;</p><p>The electrical engineer put the candle too close to the foam rubber, and it burst into flame.</p></blockquote><p>The fire, of course, began to spread out of control. Among the problems encountered during the thirty minutes between ignition and plant shutdown:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>The engineers spent 15 minutes trying to put the fire out themselves, rather than sound the alarm per protocol;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When the engineers decided to call in the alarm, no one could remember the correct telephone number;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Electricians had covered the CO<sub>2</sub> fire suppression triggers with metal plates, blocking access; and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Despite the fact that "control board indicating lights were randomly glowing brightly, dimming, and going out; numerous alarms occurring; and smoke coming from beneath panel 9-3, which is the control panel for the emergency core cooling system (ECCS)", operators tried the equivalent of unplugging the control panel and rebooting it to see if that fixed things. For ten minutes.</p></li></ol><p>This was exactly the sort of Rube Goldberg cascade predicted by Rasmussen's team. Applied to nuclear power plants, the mathematics of Probabilistic Risk Assessment ultimately showed that &#8216;nuclear events&#8217; were much more likely to occur than previously believed. But accidents also started small, and with proper planning there were ample opportunities to interrupt the cascade. The computer model of the MIT engineers seemed, in principle, to be an excellent fit to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, there are over 20,000 parts in a utility-scale plant. The path to nuclear safety was, to the early nuclear bureaucracy, quite simple: Analyze, inspect, and model the relationship of every single one of them.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>"Safe Enough?" was not written as a defense of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's regimented style. But as an outsider reading about the math for the first time, it became clear to me that once the NRC chose to implement Probabilistic Risk Assessment, an intrusive bureaucracy became its destiny.</p><p>A cursory look at the math explains why. Our flaming cat needs only one path past our defenses for the fire to spread. Our flaming cat will test them all. This means that it does no good to be right, <em>on average</em>, about individual safety measures. Being overly optimistic about any single one of the paths to disaster is functionally equivalent to being wrong about all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Asteroid deaths are rather easy to estimate - calculate the number of rocks falling from space, the density of people on the ground, and the average blast zone. Three parameters, done. It's straightforward to explain.</p><p>The public is wary of nuclear risk, in part, because it is not at all like this. Neutrons don&#8217;t simply bounce around like billiard balls. A neutron colliding with an unstable nuclear generates more neutrons<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>. There are feedback loops. The public may struggle to articulate to an expert exactly what is bothering them ("I think you have failed to account for exponential growth mechanisms, and thereby truncated the uncertainty values in your estimates," says Morgan Jacobs, nurse). But lay people are familiar with cats, and familiar with flames. The public possesses a rough intuition about Probabilistic Risk Assessment math that, while technically wanting, nonetheless captures its two critical aspects: (1) Small accidents will be much more likely than big accidents, but the big ones dominate the danger. And (2) the odds of an accident cascading out of control are probably higher than we expect.&nbsp;</p><p>I was eight when the Three Mile Island nuclear plant had its 'loss of containment' event. I was 15 when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded. I understood these events in the same terms an adolescent understands anything: The adults are lying to us. To a teenager, there was no point in entertaining a defense of the industry. The entire enterprise dripped with poison.</p><p>Risk modelers did not get hung up on stories of heroes and villains. Risk modelers could see the specifics. To the engineers at the NRC, each component in the nuclear power plant was a singular object in their computer model, topologically linked to all the others through a set of gloriously tunable and testable parameters. The problem was not that society relied too much on the volatile and impenetrable math of Probabilistic Risk Assessment. It was that we did not take it seriously enough.</p><p>In a world where industry and activists fought to a standstill, Probabilistic Risk Assessment provided the only credible guiding light. Rasmussen and team first began to compile and model relevant data in the early 1970s. Over the decades the industry&#8217;s database grew, and the NRC developed an opinion on every valve, every pipe, the position of every flashing light in a plant. This angered the utilities, who could not move a button on a control panel without reams of test data and its associated paperwork. This angered activists when the refinement of models predicted safety margins could be relaxed.&nbsp;</p><p>But Probabilistic Risk Assessment has no emotions. Probabilistic Risk Assessment estimated, validated, learned. Probabilistic Risk Assessment would form the barrier protecting us from catastrophe.</p><p>Was this hubris?</p><p>Wellock's book is big on stories yet short on raw data. But a dive into the academic literature shows that, on implementing the teachings of Probabilistic Risk Assessment after Three Mile Island and (especially) Chernobyl, the rate of nuclear 'events'<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/risa.12587"> dropped by over a factor of 4</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png" width="720" height="732" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e17949b-e5a9-4424-9cb0-1e82a401969c_720x732.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:732,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Events Per Reactor Per Year \n0.003 \n0.007 \n0.015 &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Events Per Reactor Per Year

And in story after story, Wellock shows that it actually worked.</p><p>So did Probabilistic Risk Assessment deliver, and make nuclear power "Safe Enough?"</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>On March 16th, 2011, Japanese Prime Minister Kan Naoto learned that he would not have to evacuate Tokyo<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a>.</p><p>This was five days after the T&#333;hoku earthquake, a slippage between tectonic plates so powerful that it moved Honshu, the main island of Japan, 2.4 meters to the east. The earthquake generated a tsunami 14 meters high, rolling over the coastline and submerging the protective sea walls of the Fukushima nuclear reactor. The water cut the plant&#8217;s electrical connection to the mainland and drowned its backup generators. Pumps responsible for passing 70 tons of water an hour to cool the reactors failed. Temperatures inside began to rise.</p><p>The next day, March 12th, the reactor Unit 1 melted down. Water began to react with the zirconium metal that made up the reactor walls, forming hydrogen. Pressure increased, pushing the hot gas through microscopic cracks in the vessel walls until it encountered oxygen outside. The resulting explosion spewed radioactive contamination throughout the building, and into the surrounding air.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 14th reactor Unit 3 exploded. On March 15th reactor Unit 4 exploded as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Unit 4 was the worry. It housed over 1500 spent fuel rods in open, water-filled pools at the top of the building, without any concrete structure surrounding it. With no active recirculating pumps, the water in these pools would heat and evaporate. When the pools dried out - or if the building collapsed, when it spilled out - the plant would become too radioactive to approach. Nuclear reactions would proceed uncontrolled. Radioactive cesium would release directly into the air, and be carried by winds into the surrounding population centers, possibly including Tokyo.</p><p>Before March 16th, the water levels in the pools were unknown.</p><p>In the worst case scenario, not made public until long after the disaster, the entire Tokyo Metropolitan Area - 35 million people - would have to be moved to temporary shelter. The very existence of the nation of Japan was at stake. And no one - not TEPCO, the utility that owned Fukushima, not the Prime Minister, not the Japanese military - could do anything but hope.</p><p>On March 16th, a military helicopter visually confirmed the rods were still submerged. Water, stored in the reactor above, had fortuitously cascaded downwards to refill the pool after Unit 4 exploded. The holding pool's temperature was near boiling, but the fuel rods were safe. The unthinkable remained unthought.</p><p>Wellock is sympathetic to the notion that a full-throated embrace of Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Japan could have prevented Fukushima as well. The NRC had learned, from a second near-disaster at Toledo's Davis-Besse plant in 2001<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a>, that corrosion in the culture of an organization could be just as dangerous as corrosion in materials. This was certainly true of TEPCO - the utility had considered, but rejected, higher walls to keep out the ocean from even a tsunami this large. The plant managers at the time opted to avoid publicly visible upgrades, ironically because they feared that new safety measures would relay the unwanted message that nuclear power was untrustworthy.</p><p>In hindsight it is clear that <a href="https://www.nirs.org/wp-content/uploads/fukushima/naiic_report.pdf">TEPCO performed poorly</a>. It is less certain that it is realistic for nuclear operators and agencies to achieve perfect performance, in all countries, at all times. The Fukushima meltdown did not start with an accumulation of minor crises that Probabilistic Risk Assessment predicted would dominate failure. The T&#333;hoku earthquake was larger than was thought to be possible on the Honshu fault. Vulnerability to nuclear catastrophe might have sharpened through a slow accumulation of poor decisions. But the physical process was kicked off by a single, devastating event.</p><p>As a hero's journey, Wellock's history of Probabilistic Risk Assessment ends with disappointment. Our main character is forged in battle, its power spreads to dominate the kingdom, and then is&#8230; drowned by a Tsunami?&nbsp;</p><p>This is it? No triumph of nuclear safety? No happily ever after?</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>There is a temptation to record accidents like Fukushima as aberrations. The most important lesson of Probabilistic Risk Assessment, at least as applied to nuclear power, is that outliers like Fukushima are not simply one-off events that can be explained away as special circumstances. Outliers are, in many ways, the only events that matter.</p><p>This is where "Safe Enough?" is weakest. Wellock faithfully reports on what people said about math, but never allows the math to speak for itself. While engineering is the main character in this play, it exists like a Buddhist monk, in the perpetual present. It acts, or it is acted upon. It has no backstory, and it bodes no future.&nbsp;</p><p>To flesh out the character's motivations, we have to place history aside, and focus like NRC&#8217;s engineers on the equations themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Accidents that play out sequentially over time usually are best modeled as a cascade<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>. Left uncorrected, cascades grow exponentially in scale, one grain of rice falling down a pile to dislodge two, which fall further to dislodge four, then eight, then sixteen, until the entire pile collapses. If we were to run experiments on rice piles as our model of cascades, we'd find there is no 'average' collapse, a fact that is true both mathematically and metaphorically. Most events are small, insignificant. Then, without warning, a single occurrence dwarfs anything else experienced, with the number of fallen rice grains capped only by the size of the pile itself.</p><p>Earthquakes are cascades: The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquake-magnitude-energy-release-and-shaking-intensity">1960 Valdivia earthquake</a> off the coast of Chile was not simply big, it released a quarter of the combined energy of every earthquake ever recorded. Forest fires are cascades: The<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf"> Camp Fire in California in 2018</a> destroyed as many structures as the next seven largest California fires combined.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear events are really two cascades in one. The first cascade is a loss of mechanical control, with damage largely limited to the physical plant itself. Left to continue, these failures trigger a second cascade, &#8216;loss of containment&#8217;, release of radiation to the broader world. Scientists have christened these sorts of linked cascades with the name '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200307191435id_/https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.022127">dragon kings</a>', befitting their immense power. Fukushima and Chernobyl were not simply the most extreme nuclear events on record, they were hundreds of times more costly than the next largest examples. It is not simply difficult to estimate the exact size of a particular nuclear event. It is difficult to estimate its order of magnitude.</p><p>We'd like to take comfort in the facts we have measured: Even considering Chernobyl and Fukushima, the economic and physical damages attributed to nuclear accidents have proven historically small. Nuclear advocates correctly point out that the solar and wind industry have caused more deaths than nuclear. (Exposure to radiation creates a probability of death; a tumble from sixteen stories creates certainty.) The total cost to clean Chernobyl and Fukushima may exceed a trillion dollars, but even consideration of this 'tax' would add only a penny or two per kWh to all the energy the industry has created in its history. The health and environmental damage from coal is easily ten times this.</p><p>Still. The advocates who intone solemnly on the importance of analyzing nuclear energy in terms of dispassionate numbers, as above, use the wrong models. To estimate the potential impact of cascades, we cannot simply average what has been. Our models have to consider the total damage possible - the number of rice grains in our pile, the energy of the atoms in our nuclear fuel.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011 Japan experienced an immense amount of bad luck, punctuated by a single bit of good: Fukushima Reactor 4's exposed fuel rods stayed immersed. The avalanche of disaster stopped. Tokyo was spared.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it right to ignore the cost of the evacuation of Tokyo, merely because an unplanned flow of water saved us? What if we assume the maximum cost of a nuclear event is not $1 trillion for the Fukushima we lived, but $10 trillion for the Fukushima we escaped<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>? [5]&nbsp; Is nuclear still safe enough then? Five decades of development Probabilistic Risk Assessment has answered innumerable small questions about nuclear energy, but has failed to address the one question we care most about.</p><p>In the end, "Safe enough?" is simply not a proper question to ask of a cascade. There is no conspiracy of industry or activists manipulating the public and hiding the truth. If Wellock&#8217;s readers leave the book unsatisfied, that is not entirely the fault of the writer. It&#8217;s the nature of the math.&nbsp;</p><p>To take Probabilistic Risk Assessment seriously requires that we think beyond intuition and experience, and place our faith in an intricate web of calculations and simulations. That we celebrate meticulousness over freedom and invention. That we recognize that while our vigilance will protect us from some catastrophes, it will never shield us entirely.</p><p>In 2019 three executives of TEPCO - their chairman and the two leads of their nuclear division - were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/business/japan-tepco-fukushima-nuclear-acquitted.html">found not responsible</a> in criminal court for the Fukushima disaster that occurred under their watch. In a victory for the nuclear industry, the presiding judge, Kenichi Nagafuchi, wrote without irony, &#8220;It would be impossible to operate a nuclear plant if operators are obliged to predict every possibility about a tsunami and take necessary measures."</p><p>Despite all the benefits of Probabilistic Risk Assessment, the judge's words were not wrong. "Safe enough" remains forever the illusion we live with, until the moment we don't.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Fun fact: There are about 40,000 generations of neutrons <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/neutron-generation.html">every second</a>.

We know this because one million polls have asked people &#8220;do you think morality is declining?&#8221; and people always answer yes. MG go over these one million polls, do statistics to them, and find that people definitely think that morality is declining. People have thought this since at least 1949, when the first good polls were run - but realistically much longer.</p><p>This could be (they say) either because morality is actually declining, or because of a bias. They argue that morality is not actually declining. In support, they marshal many polls asking questions like &#8220;Do you think most people are honest?&#8221; or &#8220;Do you think people treat you with respect?&#8221; and find that the answers mostly stay the same. Might this be because of definition creep - eg might people define &#8220;honest&#8221; relative to expectations, and expectations lower as morality declines? In order to rule this out, MG look at various objective questions that they think bear on morality, like &#8220;have you been mugged/assaulted recently?&#8221; or &#8220;have you donated blood in the past year?&#8221; They find that all of these have also stayed the same. Therefore, both people&#8217;s subjective impressions of morality, and more objective proxies for social morality, have stayed the same. Therefore, morality is not actually declining. Therefore there must be a bias.</p><p>MG suggest two biases that might create this illusion. First, people are better at remembering positive than negative events, so they might remember disproportionately good things about the past. Second, people are better at attending to negative events in general, and maybe this negatively biases their assessment of the present. </p><p>Speaking of biases, I&#8217;ll be honest - I&#8217;m biased against this study. </p><p>I&#8217;m biased against the introduction, where they pull the old trick of starting with a quote on how society is falling apart, then revealing it was from Livy writing in the first-century Roman Empire. They expect us to be shocked, as if every essay on moral decline hasn&#8217;t used the same flourish since - well, since the first-century Roman Empire. </p><p>I&#8217;m biased against the conclusion, which is &#8220;therefore, conservatives are wrong, so we should refocus from their fake fears onto the problems liberals care about&#8221; (think I&#8217;m strawmanning? Read the last paragraph of the Discussion section)</p><p>But I&#8217;m especially biased because I&#8217;ve been reading the biases and heuristics literature for fifteen years now, and developed the following heuristic: if a researcher finds that ordinary people are biased about how many marshmallows to take in a rigged experiment, this is probably an interesting and productive line of research. But if a researcher finds that ordinary people are biased about their most foundational real-life beliefs, probably those ordinary people are being completely sensible, and it&#8217;s the researcher who&#8217;s trying to shoehorn their reasoning into some mode it was never intended to address. And this study addresses some pretty foundational beliefs!</p><p>But aside from all these biases - wait, they found that the same number of people said they were mugged/assaulted recently in 1949 as today? <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/violence-america-what-does-it-mean">Hasn&#8217;t violent crime approximately tripled since then?</a> </p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>I think their measures of &#8220;objective morality&#8221; are not very good. Their evidence that morality has actually stayed the same over time is proof by exhaustion - a giant pile of hundreds of polls nobody wants to sort through - without much work to show that these polls bear on the question. Four issues are particularly concerning: timescale, accuracy, measurement, and sensitivity.</p><p><em><strong>Timescale:</strong> </em>The paper claims to be measuring this effect since 1949, but this only applies to subjective perceptions of decline. Their measurements of &#8220;objective&#8221; morality don&#8217;t go back nearly as far. Only one of their hundred-odd polls goes back as far as the 1960s; three more are from the 1970s<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>. The overwhelming majority analyze the period 2000 - 2015.</p><p>But when people say &#8220;there was more morality back in the good old days&#8221;, they rarely mean &#8220;in 2000 compared to 2015&#8221;. Even if moral decline were constant and linear, 2000 - 2015 might be too short a period for ordinary people to notice the difference.</p><p>If the few &#8216;60s and &#8216;70s polls were good, this might provide proof of concept that the same trends detected there were continuing through the 2000 - 2015 period. But the &#8216;60s and &#8216;70s polls are not good.</p><p><em><strong>Accuracy: </strong></em>The lone &#8220;objective&#8221; polling series which goes back to the &#8216;60s is &#8220;Is there any area near where you live -- that is, within a mile -- where you would be afraid to walk alone at night?&#8221; I think it&#8217;s the same question represented <a

doesn&#8217;t work. </p><p>Part of this could be because people&#8217;s feelings are unmoored from reality. But also, when violent crime increased in the 70s, many people responded by fleeing to the suburbs. In the 60s, in the city center, they felt comfortable walking alone at night. Now, in the suburbs, still they feel comfortable walking alone at night. The crime rate is different, but the poll answers haven&#8217;t changed.</p><p>But not only are polls a bad proxy for violent crime, violent crime is a bad proxy for morality.</p><p>The incarceration rate today is 3-4x that of the 1960s; part of this is because punishments are stricter (eg &#8220;three strikes&#8221; laws). This artificially lowers violent crime rates; would-be violent criminals are stuck in jail, unable to re-offend. If moral fiber is declining, the justice system might pick up the slack, causing the decline to be represented in more prison rather than more victimization.

It shows that the percent of people who find others trustworthy has gone down from about 45% to about 30% over ~50 years. At this rate, in another century or so 0% of people will consider other people trustworthy. This doesn&#8217;t look like no moral decline. This looks like precipitous and concerning moral decline! And remember, I&#8217;m not cherry-picking: this is one of only two non-crime questions they have going this far back (the other also shows a decline, though less pronounced).</p><p>So how did they conclude that these kinds of questions imply no moral decline? I&#8217;m not sure. They describe their statistical methodology as:</p><blockquote><p>The results of both analyses were clear: people&#8217;s reports of the current morality of their contemporaries were stable over time. On average, the year in which the survey was conducted explained less than 0.3% of the variance in responses, and in almost all cases it explained less than 1% (Supplementary Table <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x#MOESM1">4</a>). This result was confirmed by Bayesian analysis, which showed that 100% of the HDI was within the ROPE in all but one case, indicating that any changes over time were negligible at best.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not a statistician and I can&#8217;t say for sure what these mean. But I think &#8220;the year in which the survey was conducted explained less than 0.3% of the variance in responses&#8221; is a statement about r^2 statistics. The r^2 statistic of the graph above is listed as &#8220;.008&#8221;. I think (not at all sure!) that this means &#8220;the year of the survey explained only 0.8% of the variance in responses&#8221;. That sounds tiny. But looking at the graph, the effect looks big. I would file this under <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/attempts-to-put-statistics-in-context">&#8220;talking about percent variance explained is a known way to make effects sound small&#8221;</a>, although I&#8217;m not sure about this and I welcome criticism from someone more statistically-literate.</p><p>Likewise, I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;100% of the HDI was within the ROPE&#8221; means, but I know they say it was true of the graph above, meaning they classify the graph above as showing &#8220;negligible change over time&#8221;. This seems concerning and wrong to me. I&#8217;m not an expert on these measures, I could be misunderstanding all of this, and it&#8217;s more of a question mark than an accusation; still, it concerns me.</p><p><em><strong>Sensitivity: </strong></em>Crime and trust are pretty relevant, and 1960 or 1970 is a while back, so these are the kinds of questions which, if done correctly, might have been interesting. But many others seem more specific or limited.</p><p>For example, there are a bunch of polls like:</p><ul><li><p>Compared to the past, have things gotten better, worse or stayed the same [regarding] treating Hispanics with respect and courtesy? (2002 vs. 2013)</p></li><li><p>Compared to the past, have things gotten better, worse or stayed the same [regarding] treating gay people with respect and courtesy? (2002 vs. 2013)</p></li><li><p>Compared to the past, have things gotten better, worse or stayed the same [regarding] treating African-Americans with respect and courtesy? (2002 vs. 2013)</p></li></ul><p>Not only are these very specific, but remember, MG&#8217;s conclusion is that morality has not really changed since 1949. But clearly we have started treated African-Americans better since then. Shouldn&#8217;t their methods be able to pick this up?</p><p>They mention in the text that these kinds of questions did better than others; 50% report improved treatment of gay people. But what are the other 50% thinking??! The answer has to be something like &#8220;2002 to 2013 is too short a time to measure even extremely large effects that were centered around exactly this period&#8221;. But then what does that mean for the rest of their data?</p><p>Despite these questions, they report no change overall in morality. Is this because their methods are too weak to notice not just the improvement in gay rights over the early 2000s, but even the improvement in African-Americans&#8217; condition since the 1950s? Or is it because these moral improvements have been counterbalanced by other moral declines since then for net zero gain? Either way this doesn&#8217;t reflect well on their thesis.</p><p>I think MG were most interested in talking about potential biases that could cause an illusion of moral decline. In order to get there, they had to argue that there was no objective moral decline, but they thought this was obviously true, and were more interested in gesturing at it than really proving it. They threw together a mountain of polls vaguely related to the topic, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re really able to defend those polls&#8217; relevance to this question against sustained challenge.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>So am I claiming that morality <em>is</em> declining over time?</p><p>A real answer to this question would require philosophical groundwork that this paper doesn&#8217;t even begin. Whatever the issues with the data, they&#8217;re the least of MG&#8217;s problems<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a>. They&#8217;ve committed themselves to haphazardly combining polls on violent crime, blood donation, homophobia, volunteerism, and workplace abuse into a single construct, &#8220;morality&#8221;, and then making sweeping pronouncements about it.</p><p>&#8220;So the problem is they&#8217;re mixing up too many things?&#8221; No, they&#8217;re still mixing up too <em>few</em> things. </p><p>In all the hundred-ish polls that MG used as objective morality indicators, I counted zero that involved sex, marriage, divorce, child-rearing, drugs, alcohol, loyalty, patriotism, respect for elders, hard work, laziness, religion, or anything about God.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></p><p>Suppose you were born in 1940. You learned from your parents that morality was about going to church, staying chaste until marriage, loving your country, working hard, and staying away from drugs.</p><p>You notice that between 1940 and 2020:</p><ul><li><p>Church membership declined <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx">from </a>75% &#8594; 50%</p></li><li><p>Premarital sex rate went <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/shame-game-one-hundred-years-economic-model-rise-premarital-sex-and-its-de">from </a>from 20% &#8594; 75%</p></li><li><p>Trust in government went <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/11/23/1-trust-in-government-1958-2015/">from</a> 75% &#8594; 20%</p></li><li><p>Prime-age-male-labor-force nonparticipation rate quadrupled <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/19/technological-unemployment-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">from </a>3% &#8594; 12%</p></li><li><p>Marijuana use went <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/353645/nearly-half-adults-tried-marijuana.aspx">from</a> 4% &#8594; 49%</p></li></ul><p>You describe this state of affairs as &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about a moral decline&#8221;. Then some psychologists pounce on you with one million graphs showing that <em>actually</em> we respect Hispanics as much as ever which means you&#8217;re just biased.</p><p>So an alternative explanation for widespread perception of moral decline is that each generation observes moral decline relative to its own standards. If you were born in 1940, you absorbed 1940 morality. The year 2020 does worse at 1940 morality than the year 1940 did, because the year 2020 isn&#8217;t trying to achieve 1940 morality, it&#8217;s trying to achieve 2020 morality, which is only partly correlated<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>.</p><p>This neatly explains MG&#8217;s finding that everyone believes morality peaked around the year of their birth and has been declining ever since. In fact, it explains the data better than MG&#8217;s own hypothesis: they find a marginal trend for people to rate morality worse 40 years before their birth than 20, which doesn&#8217;t fit a rose-colored glasses effect but does fit an imprint-on-your-own-birth-year one.</p><p>And this is part of why I find the introductory quote by Livy so annoying. What was morality to Livy? Respecting the <em>lares</em> and <em>penates</em>. Performing the ancestral rites. Chastity until marriage, then bearing strong children (Emperor Augustus&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_trium_liberorum">famous law</a> encouraged at least three). Martial valor and willingness to die <em>pro patria</em>. Commoners treating patricians with the respect due a noble class, and patricians treating commoners with <em>noblesse oblige</em>.</p><p><a href="https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1421&amp;context=wmjowl">This paper</a> discusses some of the ancient Roman customs Livy might have been comparing favorably to the dissolute mores of his own era. They include a law that a husband could kill his wife if he caught her drinking - after all, drunkenness could lead to adultery. When Livy talked about moral decline, part of what he meant that the Romans of his day no longer had the stomach to do this. Was he wrong? Are we still equally likely to do that kind of thing today?</p><p>The correct interpretation of the Livy quote isn&#8217;t &#8220;people think morals are declining today, but Livy thought morals were declining in Rome, so clearly everyone&#8217;s equally wrong and morals are the same everywhere forever.&#8221; If Livy were to see modern America, he would consider us morally insane. No number of polls showing that respect for Hispanics stayed stable between 2002 and 2013 would change his mind. Our only recourse would be to retort back that no, <em>he</em> was morally insane.</p><p>I can&#8217;t tell you whether morality is increasing or decreasing. But a first stab would be to note that <em>wealth</em> is increasing. We might expect those virtues which wealth makes less necessary, like industry and chastity, to decline - and those virtues which wealth makes more convenient, like compassion and pacifism, to increase. Depending on how much of which virtues you put in your morality portfolio, the overall value could be going up or down. </p><p>Since I&#8217;ve been pretty harsh on this paper, let me say that I&#8217;m more sympathetic to MG&#8217;s project when they replace &#8220;moral&#8221; with specific terms like &#8220;honest&#8221; and &#8220;kind&#8221;. Some of their findings suggest that by some definitions of honesty and kindness, these constructs have stayed the same for a while. But they so often switch between definitions that I don&#8217;t think they ever manage to simultaneously demonstrate that 1) people think honesty and kindness are declining and 2) they aren&#8217;t really. I think they probably <em>could</em> demonstrate these things, and that this would make a good paper that would resemble some of the current paper and which I would approve of. I would still be agnostic as to whether this reflected a bias vs. changing definitions of &#8220;honest&#8221; and &#8220;kind&#8221;.</p><p>But the actual current paper is more ambitious, and it fails to live up to those high ambitions.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Here I&#8217;m talking mostly about objective indicators; there are some subjective questions from earlier eras.

Put simply, declaring something a &#8220;disease&#8221; is a complex category-boundary-drawing issue that combines facts and values, just like all category-boundary-drawing issues.</p><p>I said that it&#8217;s a political question whether or not you classify homosexuality as an illness. Caplan thinks of this as some sort of incredibly deep concession. But it&#8217;s a political question whether or not to classify <em>any</em> condition, including physical conditions, as illnesses. It&#8217;s just that the political question is usually very easy. This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising - most political questions are easy! &#8220;Should we set every tree in the United States on fire, then dump the entire Strategic Uranium Reserve in the Mississippi River?&#8221; - this is a political question, in the sense that you could propose it for a vote and people would have to form an opinion on it. It doesn&#8217;t show up on C-SPAN because it doesn&#8217;t satisfy anybody&#8217;s values. It&#8217;s a political fight where one side has a constituency of zero.</p><p>In the same way, &#8220;is cancer a disease?&#8221; is a political question. Maybe cancer makes you cough up blood and die. Basically everyone is against this, so it&#8217;s easy to condemn it and agree that doing it is worse than not doing it. If for some reason there were some strong political constituency in favor of coughing up blood and dying, who thought were were unfairly stigmatizing this wonderful prosocial activity, then we would have to have a political fight about it. This fight would have to involve comparing values (eg being against death) rather than comparing facts (eg cancer is caused by a mutation in such and such a gene).<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></p><p>(see also: <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/">The Tails Coming Apart As Metaphor For Life</a> and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/05/ambijectivity/">Ambijectivity</a>. Categories often contain a simple region where they operate perfectly and where it would be perverse to consider them a political question even though they sort of are, and a more complex region where they start to break down and we have to agree on some final border)</p><p>Is Down Syndrome a disease? It often causes poor health and low IQ; I&#8217;m pretty against both of these things, so I would say yes. Still, there are a bunch of people who argue it isn&#8217;t, maybe because they don&#8217;t care what your health or IQ is, or because they think stigmatizes Down Syndrome patients. I think these people are wrong, but only in the same way that I think people who support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or who hate free speech, are wrong: they have bad values, they&#8217;re against human flourishing, they&#8217;re on the wrong side of a political question.</p><p>Is depression an illness? It causes you to be miserable and not be able to do most of the things you want to do. Same story. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone being in favor of this, and I hope there&#8217;s a broad base of support to continue classifying it as an illness - but it&#8217;s a value judgment.</p><p>Caplan says okay, maybe <em>sometimes</em> <em>in some ways </em>the category boundary drawing is hard, but he proposes a bright-line rule: </p><blockquote><p><em>No preference is a disease</em>. No matter how bizarre or horrible (or common or wonderful). Diseases are constraints, not preferences.</p></blockquote><p>Part of my frustration with Caplan is that I feel like I have proven this constraint/preference distinction incoherent and misleading again and again over the course of our &#8220;debate&#8221; and he&#8217;s never responded. He just keeps saying &#8220;but the constraint/preference distinction!&#8221; For the sake of completeness, I&#8217;ll give my summary of what he thinks the distinction is, plus four of what I consider to be the strongest counterarguments.</p><p>My interpretation of Bryan&#8217;s theory (I&#8217;m putting this in a quote block to specify I&#8217;m devil&#8217;s-advocating it, but this is my summary and not his):</p><blockquote><p>If we think like behaviorists, all we can really see about mental illnesses are unusual behaviors. For example, a depressed person stays in bed all day and doesn&#8217;t work. An alcoholic drinks himself to death. A psychotic person runs out in the street naked claiming to be God.</p><p>These seem like choices. You can imagine the depressed person choosing to throw parties and work hard instead. You can imagine the alcoholic choosing to throw out his beer and never drinking again. You can imagine the psychotic person choosing to put on his clothes and act normally. In fact, if you put a gun to the alcoholic&#8217;s head and threatened to shoot him if he ever drank again, probably he would stop drinking. Therefore, we should model these conditions as unusual preferences/choices, not as diseases. The hallmark of a disease is a constraint, something you cannot &#8220;choose&#8221; to overcome, something you couldn&#8217;t overcome even with a gun to your head. For example, a paralyzed person cannot choose to walk no matter how hard she wants to, or how dire the consequences for not walking. Therefore, paralysis is an unusual constraint, and depression is an unusual preference.</p><p>We may choose (for political reasons) to stigmatize certain unusual preferences. Maybe the people who have them will choose (for signaling reasons) to cooperate in their own stigmatization. But realistically these are just completely voluntary preferences. If we don&#8217;t like them, we should ask the people who have them to choose differently, instead of treating them as diseased.</p></blockquote><p>My counterarguments:</p><p><em>&#8212; 1: Counterargument From Physical Illness, Part I</em></p><p>The simple preference/constraint model clearly doesn&#8217;t describe mental illness very well. But it&#8217;s actually much worse than that. It doesn&#8217;t even describe <em>physical</em> illness.</p><p>Consider a migraine. If we think like behaviorists, all we can really say about migraines is that someone locks themselves in a dark room, clutches their head, and says &#8220;oww oww oww&#8221; a lot. If we put a gun to a migraneur&#8217;s head and threatened to kill them if they didn&#8217;t go to a loud party, they would grudgingly go to the party. So clearly (says a hypothetical version of Caplan, whose answers I must rely on because the real Caplan has never addressed this objection) migraine headaches are a preference, not a disease! Some people just like locking themselves in dark rooms, clutching their head, and saying &#8220;oww oww oww&#8221; a lot! If other people call this a &#8220;disorder&#8221;, they&#8217;re choosing to stigmatize migraineurs; if migraineurs agree it&#8217;s a disorder, they&#8217;re just trying to escape responsibility for their antisocial choices.</p><p>You could say the same about many - maybe most - physical diseases. Why not say that chronic pain is just a preference for grimacing a lot? That itchy rashes are just a preference for scratching yourself a lot? That colds are just a preference for lying in bed and blowing your nose a lot? (I believe most people with colds could get up, go to work, and avoid blowing their noses, if their lives depended on it).</p><p>Or we could <em>stop thinking like behaviorists</em>, a philosophy which nobody has taken seriously since the 1970s. Once we agree that people are allowed to have internal states, and that the rest of us are allowed to acknowledge those internal states, the paradox disappears. We can agree that the essence of migraine headaches is pain, especially pain in response to strong sensations. The essence of itchy rashes is a feeling of itchiness, which is relieved when we scratch it. The essence of colds is feeling unwell and ugh and wanting to stay in bed and having unpleasant congestion in your nasal passages. None of these particularly change your preferences. Both I (never had a migraine) and the average migraineur have a preference for not having our head be in terrible pain. But the migraineur needs to avoid bright lights in order to satisfy this preference, and I don&#8217;t. So she very reasonably avoids bright lights.</p><p>Once we&#8217;ve admitted this, it&#8217;s natural to also admit that depression involves negative emotions and low energy, that alcoholism involves a craving to drink alcohol, and that psychosis involves disturbed reasoning processes which make running out in the street naked claiming to be God seem like a good idea (all with other preferences intact). This is more parsimonious than Caplan&#8217;s theory, better matches the testimony of the mentally and physically ill themselves, and doesn&#8217;t require the mentally ill to be running some 4D-chess-style network of lies (such that actually the psychotic person&#8217;s reasoning is completely normal and they&#8217;ve just managed to perfectly trick everyone into thinking that it isn&#8217;t and tell a perfectly consistent story all the time and stick with their deception even when it presents an extreme threat to their life and freedom).</p><p><em>&#8212;  2: Counterargument From Gradients</em></p><p>Preferences and constraints naturally shade into each other. Let me give three examples.</p><p>Example 1: I am a mediocre runner, able to run about 5 km before getting tired and stopping. One day, at exactly the 5 km mark, a demon appears before me, and says it will kill me unless I run another 1 km. I&#8217;m pretty upset by this, but I gather all my willpower, try really hard, and manage to run another 1 km. Then the demon appears again and says haha, I was just joking last time, but now I&#8217;ll <em>really</em> kill you if you don&#8217;t run another 1 km. For some reason I&#8217;m gullible, I believe it, and even though I am in extreme pain I make a herculean effort and run another 1 km. Again the demon appears and makes the same threat, and this time I say sorry, I really can&#8217;t run another inch, guess I&#8217;ll die. The demon says okay, new threat, it will kill me and my entire family horribly if I don&#8217;t run another 0.1 km, but give me $1 million if I do. I call upon some kind of reserve of courage worthy of the heroes of old, put one foot in front of the other, and make it a final 0.1 km before stopping. Again, the demon says haha, fooled you, you need to run another 0.1 km. I try this, collapse, and await my impending death.</p><p>Do we argue that I had a simple preference again running 6, 7, and 7.1 km, but that my inability to run 7.2 km was a true constraint? It seems obvious that my difficulty running 7.1 km is of the same type as my difficulty running 7.2 km, and it just passed some threshold where I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore no matter how much it mattered.</p><p>Example 2: The demon puts a dimmer switch on my leg nerves. When it&#8217;s at 100%, I have totally normal movement. When it&#8217;s at 0%, I&#8217;m paralyzed from the waist down. At 25%, I can sort of kind of walk in extreme pain. The demon threatens to kill me unless I succeed, so I shamble a short distance. Then the demon turns the switch down to 24% and threatens me again; I try my best, but fail.</p><p>I think Caplan would have to say that at every level up to 25%, I simply have a preference against walking, which is fine and voluntary and my own fault and not a disease in any way. Then at 24%, it suddenly becomes a constraint inflicted on me by an outside agency and which I deserve sympathy for.</p><p>Instead, I would rather describe things that make an action difficult and unpleasant as in some sense real constraints. When the dimmer switch is at 25%, I have an external constraint making walking difficult and unpleasant, although I can overcome this and do it anyway with a strong enough incentive. When the switch is at 24%, it&#8217;s become so difficult that no incentive can make me do it. There&#8217;s no qualitative boundary, just a quantitative one.</p><p>Example 3: Try to hold your breath as long as you can (please don&#8217;t go overboard and hold it so long you pass out). If your experience is like mine, at each moment you&#8217;ll feel like - given a slight exercise of willpower - you could choose to hold your breath one more second if you so desired. But if your experience is like mine, you will also find that no amount of love or money could make you hold your breath successfully for (let&#8217;s say) three minutes.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> </p><p>Is there a point where not wanting to hold your breath any longer switches from a preference to a constraint? Or have you discovered a place, in the dark moments just before suffocation, where these concepts lose all meaning?</p><p><em>&#8212;  3: Counterargument From Physical Illness, Part II</em></p><p>Caplan claims that mental illnesses involve preferences and physical illnesses involve constraints. But a second&#8217;s thought reveals this is not actually true, even if you accept the whole preference-constraint dichotomy</p><p>Consider cancer. Cancer involves some constraints; for example, it might kill you, and you cannot choose to live instead, even if someone put a gun to your head and demanded it<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a>. But until that happens, it mostly looks like preferences. People with cancer might stay in bed, saying they feel too sick and weak to get up and do things. But if you threatened them with a gun, they could probably get up and do things. People with cancer might refuse to eat, saying they feel too nauseous and have no appetite. But if you threatened them with a gun, they could probably get down some food.</p><p>Meanwhile, plenty of mental illnesses include constraints. One of the diagnostic criteria for depression is cognitive and memory problems; people with these problems cannot choose to remember things better, even with a gun to their head. Many people with psychosis cannot speak or reason normally, even if you put a gun to their head and ask them how a healthy person would answer a question. People having panic attacks cannot choose to have a normal heartbeat, or to stop shaking or sweating. Depression and anxiety are both associated with insomnia; try to will yourself to sleep and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36595381/">you&#8217;ll sleep </a><em><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36595381/">less, </a></em><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36595381/">not more</a>.</p><p>Both physical and mental illnesses are complex bundles of preferences and constraints, which shouldn&#8217;t be surprising given that preference vs. constraint is an oversimplified distinction that breaks down outside its legitimate domain.</p><p><em>&#8212;  4: Counter-Argument From The Gun-To-The-Head Test Actually Not Working</em></p><p>A depressed person may not be able to get out of bed or live a normal life. This might get so bad that they decide to commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head. Confronted with a choice between living a normal life, or a gunshot to the head, they have chosen the gunshot<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>. It appears that they have passed the gun-to-the-head test that Caplan loves so much.</p><p>I feel bad including this one, because Caplan can fairly object that this is just another preference. Maybe depressed people completely voluntarily choose to lie in bed for a few years while falsely claiming to be miserable and then shoot themselves in the head, and all of this is a perfectly free choice that they are happy with. I cannot disprove this, only point out how unparsimonious it is.</p><p>Maybe a better example is when a psychotic person attacks the cops, the cops order him to stop or else they&#8217;ll shoot him, the psychotic person continues attacking them (eg because he believes he&#8217;s invincible) and then the police go ahead and shoot him. </p><p>Again, Caplan could say that this is just a preference for attacking cops and then being killed. But in that case he should stop touting the &#8220;gun to the head test&#8221; as meaningful. Rather, he should admit that his theory is completely unfalsifiable -  no matter what actions a mentally ill person does, what tests they pass or fail, he can just say they had a preference for doing whatever they did. </p><p>In fact, at this point I don&#8217;t see why he even has to acknowledge the existence of constraints at all. One might as well claim that a paralyzed person could walk if they wanted, but chooses not to.</p><p><strong>III. </strong></p><p>I think Caplan is groping towards something like the following criticism:</p><p>Suppose we simplify depression to &#8220;person lies in bed and doesn&#8217;t do anything all day&#8221;. Caplan&#8217;s model treats this as &#8220;depressed person has preference to lie in bed&#8221;. My model treats this as &#8220;depressed person has an abnormal mental/emotional/motivational state that makes it difficult and unpleasant for them to not lie in bed&#8221;.</p><p>Now we consider a gay person. Caplan&#8217;s model treats this as &#8220;person has a preference to be gay&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t my model have to treat this as . . . person has abnormal mental/emotional/motivational state that makes it difficult and unpleasant for them to be heterosexual?</p><p>In some sense this is true. We could imagine some very religious man from the 1950s who really wants to be straight, marry a woman, and raise a family. But due to some hormonal disturbance, he feels a very strong urge to have sex with men. </p><p>How is this different from (let&#8217;s say) depression-secondary-to-hypothyroidism, where some person really wants to live a normal life, but instead, due to a hormonal disturbance, feels unable to do anything but lie in bed?</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t seem that different to me. It also doesn&#8217;t seem that different from a straight guy who wishes he were gay (maybe for LGBTQ cred, or because it would make it much easier to find partners) but feels a very strong urge to have sex with women.</p><p>So does that mean that depression is &#8220;just a preference&#8221;? I don&#8217;t think so, because none of these scenarios seem that different from the person with the migraine either! I think the preference/constraint dichotomy is a bad way to think about about this whole class of things.</p><p>I think all of the following things shade into each other:</p><ol><li><p>A migraine. You could think of this as a preference for sitting in a dark room and saying &#8220;ow ow ow&#8221; - or as an internal state of head pain.</p></li><li><p>An itchy rash. You could think of this as a preference for scratching yourself - or as an internal state of itchiness.</p></li><li><p>Depression due to hypothyroidism. You could think of this as a preference for very low activity levels - or as an internal state of very low motivation and extreme fatigue.</p></li><li><p>Homosexuality. You could think of this as a preference for having same-sex coupling - or as an internal state with a strong urge to couple with people of the same sex (or a strong repulsion towards opposite-sex coupling).</p></li><li><p>Heterosexuality, as above.</p></li><li><p>Liking Pepsi more than Coke. You could think of this as a preference for drinking Pepsi over drinking Coke - or as an internal state marked by a strong repulsion to Coke plus a strong attraction to Pepsi. </p></li></ol><p>In the first two situations, it&#8217;s much more natural to use internal-state language, and in the sixth, it&#8217;s much more natural to use preference language. The middle three aren&#8217;t obvious, which is why we&#8217;re having this debate.</p><p>The Buddhists say desire is suffering, and sometimes this is literally true. An itch is the clearest example; it&#8217;s in an almost perfect superposition between raw suffering and pure desire (to scratch yourself). Is it a preference or a constraint? It&#8217;s both - a preference to scratch one&#8217;s self, and a constraint to be forced to feel suffering if you don&#8217;t scratch yourself. While the person may choose whether or not to scratch themselves, they cannot choose whether or not to feel the suffering. Put a gun to their head and say &#8220;stop feeling suffering when you don&#8217;t scratch yourself&#8221; and they will have no choice but to die.</p><p>It&#8217;s possible, although bizarre, to think of normal preferences like the preference for Pepsi over Coke this way. You could say &#8220;this person has the constraint that they will feel suffering when they are forced to drink Coke instead of Pepsi&#8221;. It&#8217;s not very useful. But it&#8217;s possible.</p><p>Whether it&#8217;s more useful to think of any given situation as a preference or a constraint depends on things like whether you can easily satisfy the preference, whether the preference is ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic, and whether it seems normal by social standards.</p><p>Consider Prader-Willi syndrome, caused by damage to a region of chromosome 15. Symptoms tend to include short limbs, mental retardation, and extreme hunger. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/magazine/food-is-a-death-sentence-to-these-kids.html">Here&#8217;s how the NYT describes</a> this last problem (content warning for body horror):</p><blockquote><p>One result is a heightened, permanent sensation of hunger. &#8220;They describe it as physical pain,&#8221; Jennifer Miller, an endocrinologist at the University of Florida who treats children with Prader-&#173;Willi, told me. &#8220;They feel like they&#8217;re going to die if they don&#8217;t get food. They&#8217;re starving.&#8221; Parents must lock their pantries, refrigerators and trash cans, and their children frequently lie and steal to get something to eat. They have been known to memorize credit-card numbers and secretly phone for delivery, use a drill to remove the door from a locked refrigerator and break into a neighbor&#8217;s garage and eat, uncooked, an entire frozen pizza.</p></blockquote><p>And here&#8217;s how it describes one particular patient&#8217;s last moments:</p><blockquote><p>In 2004, Peter and Gayle Girard held their annual Christmas Eve party for family members at their home in Orlando, Fla. Before dinner, they set out chips, vegetables and dip, shrimp, a bowl of punch and sodas. Their 17-year-old son, Jeremy, had Prader-&#173;Willi, and they often hosted events at their home so he could join in while they kept an eye on him &#8212; as they believed they were doing that night. But the next morning, Jeremy&#8217;s belly was distended, and he complained of pain. At the emergency room, doctors pumped his stomach, but his condition worsened. A day passed before surgeons discovered that his stomach, which had been distended long enough to lose blood flow and become septic, had ruptured. Jeremy died that night. Only afterward did the Girards learn that other family members saw him eating more than he should have but didn&#8217;t alert them.</p></blockquote><p>I insist on calling Prader-Willi syndrome a disease, and a serious one, even though the extreme hunger of Prader-Willi is continuous with/shades into the normal hunger where I would like a slice of pizza. </p><p>My preference for pizza is so easily satisfied that it rarely bothers me. It&#8217;s ego syntonic - I am fine with being the sort of person who likes pizza. It&#8217;s socially normal - everyone likes pizza. It doesn&#8217;t cause much trouble - it wouldn&#8217;t improve my life much if I stopped wanting pizza. So I think of it as a preference. If it were otherwise - the extreme hunger of someone with Prader-Willi - it would be more natural to talk about it as a compulsion, a sense of extreme pain inflicted on me when I wasn&#8217;t eating enough, something ontologically similar to a stomach flu that also produces extreme pain in the abdominal region. </p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>None of this really addresses Caplan&#8217;s most recent post, which is, I think, a much worse point.</p><p>His current post says that <em>either</em> you have to believe that mental illness doesn&#8217;t exist and is just voluntary preferences which are stigmatized by society, <em>or</em> you have to believe that homosexuality is objectively a mental illness.</p><p>Not only are each of these incoherent ideas, they&#8217;re not even the same incoherent idea! You could easily accept one of the incoherent ideas and reject the other!</p><p>Consider the following three positions:</p><ol><li><p>Down&#8217;s Syndrome is a terrible disease that inflicts vast suffering on its victims. Also it inflicts suffering on society by making people unproductive. We should be very angry about this, and do everything we can do make people with Down&#8217;s Syndrome normal.</p></li><li><p>Down&#8217;s Syndrome is a perfectly fine neurodiverse way of being human. Probably it has some disadvantages, but it also has some advantages, for example lots of people with Down Syndrome seem happy and kind. Calling this a &#8220;disease&#8221; unfairly stigmatizes people who are different.</p></li><li><p>Down Syndrome is just a voluntary preference for having eyes that are unusually far apart, congenital heart disease, and moderate intellectual disability. If they really wanted, they could stop at any time. They&#8217;re just not motivated enough!</p></li></ol><p>It&#8217;s easy to believe <em>either</em> 1 <em>or </em>2 without believing 3; there&#8217;s no reason that any political position on whether or not to call something a disease commits you to believing it to be a &#8220;preference&#8221; rather than a &#8220;constraint&#8221;.</p><p>If Caplan wants to respond to this, or to my beliefs in general, I would prefer he start with the four arguments against the constraint/preference distinction, which I think are the crux of our disagreement.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t cancer obviously, nonpolitically, an illness, in the sense that it clusters with all the other things we agree are illnesses? I think there are a few answers to this. One is that I would say Down Syndrome should also be in this category, but there are some real people who claim it&#8217;s not a disease - just because I would *like for* something not to be a political question, doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t! An even better example is aging - which involves just as much biological dysfunction as cancer, is even more fatal, and yet - because some people aren&#8217;t against it and think death is good in this one weird case - <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/19/1061070/is-old-age-a-disease/">it&#8217;s hard to get it classified as a disease</a>. Most sane classifiers, presented with all diseases other than cancer and asked to determine whether cancer is inside or outside of the category, would say inside - but it&#8217;s our job to enforce that in real life, and neither &#8220;sane classifier&#8221; nor &#8220;agreeing on all other diseases&#8221; are trivial.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Suppose that you put a gun to my head and threatened to kill me unless I cold hold my breath for X amount of time.

It took us decades to get into this mess, and just as there&#8217;s no one simple fix, there&#8217;s no one simple inflection point in our history on which we can place all the blame.</p><p>But what if there was? What if there was, in fact, a single person we could blame for this entire state of affairs, a patsy from the past at whom we could all point our censorious fingers and shout, &#8220;It&#8217;s that guy&#8217;s fault!&#8221;</p><p>There is such a person, suggests history professor Paul Sabin in his new book <em>Public Citizens: The Attack on Big Government and the Remaking of American Liberalism</em>. And he isn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t a mustache-twirling villain&#8212;he&#8217;s a liberal intellectual. If you know him for anything, it&#8217;s probably for being the reason you know what a hanging chad is.</p><p>That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s all Ralph Nader&#8217;s fault.</p><p>How&#8217;d he do it? By creating what&#8217;s now called the public interest movement: a new form of activism through which citizens force change&#8212;or, more often, block change&#8212;by suing the government. Though it was begun with the best of intentions and achieved some real good along the way, this political innovation led to the constipated governance we all complain about today.</p><p>How did a movement launched by an unassuming 30-year-old lawyer become the dominant form of activism in the country, and completely change the way our government operates?&nbsp;</p><p>To find out, we have to go back to a time before Ralph Nader had even hit puberty&#8212;the era of the New Deal.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>In the beginning, there was the New Deal.</p><p>Okay, so a lot of stuff happened in American history before then. 157 years of stuff, if you count from the Declaration of Independence, or 13,000 years of stuff, if you count from when the first human settlers are estimated to have come to North America.</p><p>But the current era of American history didn&#8217;t really begin until the New Deal in the mid-1930s. The scale of the transformation was staggering: dozens of major bills and federal agencies, including the SEC, the FHA, the FDIC, Social Security, minimum wage, collective bargaining, and the FDA&#8217;s drug-licensing powers all date back to the New Deal. Within just a few years, the federal government went from playing a largely hands-off role in the economy to touching almost every part of it.</p><p>The men who created the New Deal had an unshakeable faith in the power of experts. That&#8217;s why the New Deal relied heavily on a new model for delegating congressional powers: Congress would create a federal agency with broad latitude, then they, or the president, would staff that agency with outside experts. Freed from the grubby pressures of the political process, these agency men&#8212;and they were pretty much all men&#8212;would use their expertise to reshape the country<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority is the canonical example of a New Deal agency. Founded in 1933, it was designed to modernize the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a>, with a broad mandate including electricity generation, flood control, fertilizer manufacturing, and general economic development. Here&#8217;s what it didn&#8217;t have to do: run its plans for the valley by any of the people who actually lived there. Although the TVA was broadly popular and is still considered a success today, its development plans displaced over 125,000 residents, who had essentially no recourse. Its first leader, displaying the lack of modesty that was characteristic of the era, described the agency&#8217;s work by saying, &#8220;What God had made one, man was to develop as one.&#8221;</p><p>There was, of course, some conservative pushback to FDR&#8217;s grand plans, and by the 1940s Republicans had managed to push through a law that guaranteed a public comment period and at least some judicial review of agency rules. But for the most part, these agencies were thoroughly integrated into our politics, and the American economy settled into a relatively stable equilibrium. In his 1952 book <em>American Capitalism</em><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a>, John Kenneth Galbraith summed up this equilibrium via the concept of countervailing powers: big government, big business, and the big unions worked together to collaboratively manage the economy.</p><p>But by the 1960s, the cracks in this model were starting to show. A report prepared for President-elect Kennedy outlined the problem of regulatory capture, the process by which agencies intended to regulate private businesses got too close to their subjects and end up serving them instead<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>. And a new class of liberal intellectuals rose to prominence by pointing out the ways in which the political establishment&#8217;s plans sometimes rode roughshod over the citizens they were supposed to serve. Rachel Carson&#8217;s <em>Silent Spring</em> criticized the USDA&#8217;s indiscriminate use of pesticides, and Jane Jacobs&#8217; grassroots movement successfully blocked Robert Moses&#8212;the ultimate agency man&#8212;from ramming a highway through the West Village.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png" width="364" height="238.3021582733813" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:182,&quot;width&quot;:278,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:364,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a63dd2-1d1a-4171-87b3-05299102cf10_278x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Think about how fucked up New York would be if this had actually gotten built</figcaption></figure></div><p>For all their accomplishments, though, Carson, Jacobs, and other activists in their mold tended to stay in one lane. Their objections were to specific government plans, not to the entire structure of the plan-making apparatus. It would take someone who thought a little bigger to uproot the New Deal agency model entirely.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Ralph Nader was born in 1934 to a pair of Lebanese immigrants in Winstead, Connecticut. Many prominent activists have dramatic origin stories, but not Nader: his family was well-off, and as far as I can tell, he had a happy childhood. The family did, however, have a moralizing strain: when Nader was offered a scholarship to Princeton, his father forced him to turn it down on the grounds that their family could afford to pay<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>.</p><p>By his early twenties, Nader had become something of a hotshot at Harvard Law School, where he developed an interest in vehicle safety after one of his classmates was injured in a car crash. Post-World War II, highway construction had boomed and vehicle sales had boomed along with it, with U.S. car ownership tripling in the two decades following 1946. It was the era of Robert McNamara&#8217;s famous quote that &#8220;what&#8217;s good for GM is good for America.&#8221; But these cars were also pretty dangerous, with a per-capita vehicle death rate more than twice today&#8217;s. At Harvard, Nader proposed the then-groundbreaking, but now widely accepted, &#8220;double-injury theory&#8221;: the idea that a car accident is best conceptualized as consisting of two separate injuries, first the car itself hitting something and then the passengers hitting the inside of the car<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a>.</p><p>After graduating, Nader moved to D.C. to work for Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who would later become a powerful senator and the namesake for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moynihan_Train_Hall">disappointing train station</a> but who at the time was JFK&#8217;s Assistant Secretary of Labor. Moynihan was also interested in auto safety, and he even had a contract to write a book about the issue modeled on Upton Sinclair&#8217;s meatpacking expos&#233; <em>The Jungle</em>, but he never ended up completing it. (Presumably he was too distracted by his other work, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Family:_The_Case_For_National_Action">blaming Black poverty on &#8220;ghetto culture.&#8221;</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a>)</p><p>Into the void stepped Nader, who readily agreed to take over the contract. The resulting book, <em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em>, was published in 1965. It documented the way car manufacturers avidly resisted even simple safety improvements, and pushed for a cultural shift away from blaming accidents on individual drivers towards a more epidemiological approach that saw car accidents as a public health issue.</p><p><em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em> was a modest success, but it didn&#8217;t make too much of a stir&#8212;until, that is, it came out that in their zeal to discredit Nader, GM. had hired a team of private investigators to dig up dirt on him, even enlisting a few young women to seduce him in an attempted entrapment<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a>. Thanks to Nader&#8217;s ascetic lifestyle and complete lack of any interests outside of work, they failed spectacularly at getting anything compromising on him. But their clumsy attempts at subterfuge did manage to make Nader famous and his book a best-seller. Less than a year later, LBJ signed the Traffic Safety and Highway Safety Acts, largely due to Nader&#8217;s advocacy.</p><p>Almost single-handedly, Nader had kickstarted a new era of automotive regulation and set in motion a process that would make cars dramatically safer (albeit, unfortunately, also dramatically less cool-looking). He&#8217;d won a battle with the country&#8217;s largest company, and along the way he even got to hook up with some sexy women on GM&#8217;s dime.</p><p>Just kidding&#8212;when GM&#8217;s women invited him back to their apartment, ostensibly to &#8220;discuss foreign relations,&#8221; he suspected entrapment and declined.

(Image by Dall-E)</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>At this point, the usual thing for someone in Nader&#8217;s position to do would be to write another book and continue their path of individual activism. But Nader had grander plans. He decided to become a new kind of entrepreneur&#8212;a self-appointed &#8220;lobbyist for the public interest&#8221; who&#8217;d spread his unconventional ways among other activists.</p><p>So he started a new organization dedicated to doing just that: the Center for the Study of Responsive Law. His newfound fame enabled him to recruit a prestigious group of young lawyers from elite schools, including President Taft&#8217;s great-grandson and Ed Cox, who married Richard Nixon&#8217;s daughter while working for Nader. &#8220;It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re looking at the names of the Pullman cars,&#8221; said one of Nader&#8217;s early employees, in a joke that today requires so much explanation I almost regret including it in this piece<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a>.</p><p>Now that we live in the world Nader created&#8212;where over 10% of the American private sector workforce is at nonprofits&#8212;it&#8217;s hard to see how groundbreaking this was. The 501(c)3 hadn&#8217;t even been created yet; what few such organizations existed tended to be structured around the interests of specific identity groups and, below the level of top leadership, staffed mostly by volunteers, like the NAACP and the League of Women Voters. Nader&#8217;s group was different: an advocacy organization with an employee base of full-time professionals, dedicated to the interests of the American public at large (or at least, what they saw as the interests of the American public<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a>). In 1969, when the group started researching their first project, the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> wrote:</p><blockquote><p>So far as anyone can remember, nothing quite like this has happened in Washington before. A group of unofficial but informed outsiders&#8230;as a sort of civilian posse, has descended on a rather stuffy government commission, poked under sofas, and asked some rough questions.</p></blockquote><p>A <em>Washington Post </em>columnist nicknamed the group &#8220;Nader&#8217;s Raiders,&#8221; and it stuck. The Raiders decide that their first target would be the Federal Trade Commission, which Nader believed had become too cozy with the businesses it was supposed to regulate and failed to live up to its ostensible mission of protecting the American consumer. They quickly wrote and released a blistering report that, among other things, accused the FTC of being rife with &#8220;alcoholism, spectacular lassitude, office absenteeism, and incompetence by even the most modest standard.&#8221;</p><p>Nader and his employees were pretty much all liberals. But they were a different kind of liberal than the ones who created the New Deal. The Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement (and, later, Watergate) had caused them to lose faith in government, and they were distrustful of so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; and of centralized power in general<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a>. This distrust was why they operated through their own independent organizations, rather than by running for office or working with existing groups like the labor movement. Many of them were followers of the radical organizer Saul Alinsky, who emphasized an explanation for leadership failures that focused on structural issues, not individual choices. &#8220;Through experience,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;you learn to see people not as sellouts and betrayers. [Morality is] largely a rationalization of the point you happen to occupy in the power pattern at a given time.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, it wasn&#8217;t simply a matter of getting the right people into power, as the very act of getting into power would mean they were no longer the right people. The only way to stay pure was to operate outside the system.</p><p>Nader also believed that if you wanted to accomplish something, you shouldn&#8217;t attack your enemies&#8212;you should attack your friends. Your enemies, after all, already hate you. But your friends are incentivized to listen. As such, his group&#8217;s FTC report primarily criticized Democrats. And Democrats were pissed. Speaker of the House Jim Wright later wrote that Nader was like a rookie football player who thinks you win games by tackling your own quarterback.</p><p>But Nader&#8217;s theory had legs. In the fallout from the report&#8217;s release, Congress gave the FTC expanded powers and mandated citizen participation in its decisions. His team soon ran the same playbook with, among many other things, workplace safety and air and water pollution. His team&#8217;s advocacy was instrumental in getting the Clean Air Act (1970) and Clean Water Acts (1971) passed, two of the largest pieces of environmental legislation of all time<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a>.</p><p>The Clean Air and Clean Water Acts had major differences with previous laws of their type, spurred by what Nader believed were flaws in the older approach. Although these laws continued to rely on agencies staffed with outside experts, they rejected the New Deal style of fully deferring to them. Instead, they gave the agencies they created extremely detailed mandates, procedures, and timelines. They required judicial review of agency decisions, and explicitly empowered citizens to sue the agencies for not following the rules. (Previously, it wasn&#8217;t clear that a random individual American would have standing in such a case.) As one of Nader&#8217;s top men said, these new laws were designed to be &#8220;government-proof.&#8221;</p><p>If Nader was famous after <em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em>, he became even more famous now. And his dream of getting more lawyers into public service had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations. In 1968, he gave a barnburner of a speech with a title that sounds like it was taken from a fantasy novel: &#8220;Law Schools and Law Firms: The Mordant Malaise or the Crumbling of the Old Order,&#8221; which railed against law schools for corrupting young lawyers. The next year, an entire<em> one-third</em> of Harvard Law&#8217;s graduating class applied to work with him.</p><p>This was despite the fact that Nader was, by all accounts, an absolutely atrocious boss, someone who had no interests outside of work and a nonexistent personal life. He never married or, as far as I know, had any romantic relationships whatsoever, ostensibly so he could devote himself to his career full-time. He pushed his employees to work hundred-hour weeks and was notorious for calling them while they were on vacation and berating them for not working.</p><p>By the mid-seventies, Nader was at the height of his influence. George McGovern briefly considered him for vice president, but Nader said no, and also refused entreaties to run as a third-party candidate&#8212;at this point, he was staunchly against getting involved in electoral politics. After Jimmy Carter received the Democratic nomination in 1976, he took a three-hour meeting with Nader, where Nader spent the entire time lecturing him about how government &#8220;really&#8221; worked. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell said, &#8220;Nader is the single most effective antagonist of American business,&#8221; which Nader probably took as a compliment.</p><p>But his real influence lay in the many other groups his example inspired. Some, like the Environmental Defense Fund, were explicitly modeled on Nader&#8217;s organizations. Others, like the Sierra Club, long predated Nader but began copying his tactics. The number of active nonprofits tripled during the 1970s.</p><p>Initially, the vast majority of these groups were left-leaning, but pretty soon conservative activists got in the game too. And why wouldn&#8217;t they? Although he&#8217;s often caricatured as a radical liberal, there was something very small-c conservative about the way Nader and his ilk operated. They were heavily distrustful of government and spent most of their time either publishing reports criticizing the government or just suing the government directly. (In the first two years of the Nader-inspired Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, a whopping 70 of their 77 lawsuits were filed against the government!) And the laws they pushed for were designed with that distrust in mind.</p><p>Except it&#8217;s not totally accurate to call it a distrust of<em> government</em>. Because while, in Nader&#8217;s view, the legislative and executive branches may have been inevitably pulled towards corruption, there was one branch he and his allies did trust: the courts. Nader&#8217;s philosophy was one of justice by lawsuit. Make it easy for individual citizens, or the groups representing them, to sue, and the legal process will handle the rest. It was like Nader and his team had discovered a cheat code to punch way above their weight class. Litigation, said the Environmental Defense Fund, produced results &#8220;faster than by lobby, ballot box, or protest.&#8221;</p><p>And those results were often spectacular. Like when the Nader-founded Center for Law and Social Policy sued to stop construction of the Trans-Alaska pipeline under the new (and Nader-influenced) National Environmental Policy Act. CLASP, less than two years old when the lawsuit was filed, had only a dozen or so employees. And yet they managed to obtain an injunction that halted construction of the pipeline for several years. The world (or at least, the small part of it that paid attention to this sort of thing) was stunned. A tiny law firm that most people in DC hadn&#8217;t even heard of had, for the time being at least, stopped one of the largest and most ambitious engineering projects in American history.</p><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p>And so on, and so on, and so on. Nader and his acolytes spawned generations of copycats and they sued and advocated and sued and advocated and in response, we blanketed government agencies under new layers of rules that constrained how they could operate. The public interest movement wasn&#8217;t the only force behind this push for procedure, of course. But it was a major one.</p><p>Eventually we got to the America of today: one with tens of thousands of public interest nonprofits, and one where an ambitious young person who wants to make a difference in politics is far more likely to join a nonprofit that sues the government than to join the government itself.</p><p>Individually, the changes the public interest movement pushed for&#8212;among them, comment periods for rulemaking, thorough environmental review, pre-enforcement review of agency rules, and ubiquitous court challenges&#8212;seemed like reasonable ideas. But collectively, they stymied the government's ability to do anything. Ironically, the very policies the progressives of the seventies helped put in place now stand in the way of the government action today&#8217;s progressive movement demands.</p><p>And in hindsight, Nader&#8217;s belief that stricter procedures could prevent regulatory capture seems hopelessly na&#239;ve. As it turns out, reducing agencies&#8217; discretion and layering on detailed processes doesn&#8217;t actually prevent the wealthy and powerful from taking advantage of the system. If anything, additional bureaucracy actually further enables such manipulation, since only the most dedicated and well-resourced actors can effectively game complex procedures.</p><p>Today, business groups dominate agency notice and comment periods, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00375.x">submitting almost ten time as many comments</a> as public interest groups or individual citizens<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a>. Industry submits <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1531243">over 80%</a> of all comments to the EPA. And the Freedom of Information Act&#8212;championed by Nader, and hailed as an unprecedented mechanism for government transparency when it was passed in 1966&#8212;is today <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol65/iss7/2/">mostly used</a> by businesses for profit-making purposes<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a>. Among the many projects blocked or delayed by lawsuit activism&#8212;or the excessive legal review designed to preempt it&#8212;are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Rail_Transit">public transit in Hawaii</a>, wind farms on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Wind">Cape Cod</a> and <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/new-york/2022/10/12/wind-turbines-on-lake-ontario-shoreline-hit-headwinds-in-wny/69547381007/">upstate New York</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AidanRMackenzie/status/1637937332954484739">NYC congestion pricing</a>, not to mention the millions of new homes around the country we should be building but aren&#8217;t.</p><p>The public interest movement&#8217;s legalistic approach also came with hidden costs. Their theory of change rested on the intense efforts of a small group of educated, elite insiders. As such, their fights often happened behind the scenes&#8212;they may have been acting in the public interest, but that didn&#8217;t always mean the public was interested. And their arguments, tuned for the courtroom, often relied on technicalities rather than on broad theories of justice.</p><p>But the courts are better at tearing down than they are at building up. Nader&#8217;s movement stopped or delayed a lot of things it was against, but it was much less effective at painting, let alone implementing, a positive vision of what should be built in their place. Single-mindedly pursuing this inside-game strategy also came at the expense of coalition and movement-building, which left many of these groups&#8217; victories flimsier than they first appeared.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any coincidence that Nader&#8217;s most effective and enduring impact on American society&#8212;the push for auto safety that first made him famous&#8212;is also the one where, through TV appearances and his book, he built the broadest base of public support. Yes, the legislation he pushed for established stricter standards for how cars were built and tested. But the reason that legislation hasn&#8217;t been neutered by loopholes&#8212;and the reason those standards have continued to get tougher and tougher in the sixty years since&#8212;is because a majority of the public was convinced of Nader&#8217;s views.</p><p>Still, I don&#8217;t think any of this means Nader and his allies were necessarily wrong to pursue the strategy they did. The changes the public interest movement wrought did a lot of good, and it would be a mistake to suggest we&#8217;d have been better off without it just because the changes had some unintended consequences.</p><p>Besides, some of this backsliding was probably inevitable. The history of governance is one of constant see-sawing: we confidently implement a change we&#8217;re sure is going to fix everything, only to discover it has unexpected loopholes or unforeseen side effects. We get rid of earmarks to reduce corruption, only to find we&#8217;ve gummed up the works of Congress by removing an essential dealmaking tool. We push for open primaries to reduce the influence of men in smoke-filled rooms, only to find that we&#8217;ve opened a path to power for populist demagogues. And we create independent agencies staffed by outside experts who we think will be immune to the sleaziness of the political process, but they end up insufficiently responsive to the will of the people, so we add a bunch of rules and regulations to give the public a greater voice, but they end up monopolized by a small minority or stifling the agencies&#8217; ability to accomplish anything at all.</p><p>It is the inherent nature of politics that no reform works forever, because the next generation of political entrepreneurs will inevitably discover new ways to bend the process to their will. Eventually, there will always be another Dick Fosbury revealing a way to work the system that no one saw coming.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png" width="467" height="316" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:316,&quot;width&quot;:467,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ef0014-1e04-43c1-a085-0f617ab9bbb7_467x316.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Fosbury flop, a high jump style where you arch yourself backwards over the pole, was revolutionary when its namesake used it to win the gold medal in the 1968 Summer Olympics.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Still, I do think some of the blame for the way this all panned out can be laid on Nader&#8217;s particular personal idiosyncrasies. His ironclad black-and-white view of the world, combined with his near-pathological aversion to dealmaking and compromise, made him uniquely suited to a form of activism that focused on regulatory and legal action rather than coalition-building and electoral politics. Nader was infamously rigid and inflexible, so it&#8217;s no surprise that his movement was too. But a less rules-oriented movement might have created fewer of the bureaucratic barriers that have now become a hindrance to progressive action.</p><p>Much like the movement whose story it tells, <em>Public Citizens </em>the book is a worthwhile project that nonetheless suffers from significant flaws. The main problem is that it can&#8217;t decide if it&#8217;s a historical narrative or a work of political theory. As a work of political theory, it doesn&#8217;t take nearly a strong enough stand&#8212;I&#8217;ve made explicit a lot of claims that are only lightly implied in the book. I <em>think</em> we&#8217;re making the same argument, but the book makes its argument with such a delicate touch that it&#8217;s hard to be 100% sure.</p><p>As a historical narrative, <em>Public Citizens</em> has a much simpler problem: it&#8217;s boring. The author writes like an academic (which, to be fair, he is), and the book is quite light on colorful details. The uncreative chapter titles (chapter three is called &#8220;Creating Public Interest Firms&#8221;) give you a taste of what the writing is like. One particularly egregious issue is how little biographical information is provided about Nader, even though the majority of the book is about him. For someone who apparently subscribes to the Great Man theory of history, the author includes surprisingly little information about the Great Men themselves. Any interesting biographical fact you read in this review&#8212;even something as basic as the fact that Nader never married&#8212;is almost certainly something I found through other sources.</p><p>Paradoxically, this book manages to be simultaneously boring <em>and</em> too concise. It&#8217;s over in less than 200 generously-spaced pages, and I frequently had to look stuff up on the internet to get a full understanding of what was going on. I get the sense that the author is trying to give this book mass appeal, but come on: anyone who&#8217;s willing to read a nerdy book like this is willing to read an additional hundred pages or so. Besides, Robert Caro and Ron Chernow have proven that people will read thousand-page tomes if the story is compelling and the details are juicy.</p><p>Basically, my critique of <em>Public Citizens</em> is like that old Catskills joke about the restaurant where the food is terrible&#8212;and the portions are too small.</p><p><strong>VI.</strong></p><p>We&#8217;re now over four thousand words into this review, and I&#8217;ve barely even mentioned the 2000 election. While that infamous debacle isn&#8217;t a core part of this story, I do think it&#8217;s worth a quick postscript. How did someone like Nader&#8212;a staunch believer in staying outside the system who repeatedly refused his supporters&#8217; requests that he seek elected office&#8212;end up running a doomed third-party campaign, and in the process help elect a president who worsened America way more than Nader ever improved it?</p><p>The answer starts with Nader&#8217;s uncompromising moral worldview. There never has been, and probably never will be, a president who lived up to his extreme standards. Take Jimmy Carter: even though Carter granted Nader unprecedented personal access, and even though many Naderites had high-level positions in Carter&#8217;s administration, Nader did nothing but criticize him, and in fact actively undermined his re-election<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a>. &#8220;Reagan will help [our movement]&#8221; by galvanizing the opposition, Nader predicted, comically inaccurately. Decades later he <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/11/07/the-surprising-greatness-of-jimmy-carter/">finally admitted</a> that Carter had in fact been the most pro-consumer president of his lifetime.</p><p>So of course when the nineties came around Nader viewed the Clintons with equal disdain, oblivious to the fact that the anti-government liberalism he pioneered was part of what brought about &#8220;Third Way&#8221; Democrats like Clinton and Gore. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3dvbM6Pias">that Rage Against the Machine video</a>, he saw Bush and Gore as one and the same&#8212;&#8220;tweedledee and tweedledum,&#8221; he called them. Having learned nothing from the Reagan years, he once again inaccurately predicted that a Bush victory would actually be better for the country, because it would fire up the progressive movement.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png" width="1258" height="844" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:844,&quot;width&quot;:1258,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89574cce-a2d7-4570-bad4-4dbf030bb667_1258x844.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">&#8220;Testify,&#8221; Rage Against the Machine&#8217;s 2000 banger, showed Bush and Gore repeatedly morphing into the same person</figcaption></figure></div><p>But it really seems like another piece of the puzzle is that Nader just wanted attention. Despite his unassuming nature, he loved the spotlight, and he&#8217;d been in it a lot less since the late seventies, when his career had peaked. Now here he was, on TV all the time and being treated like a major candidate. He bragged to Jim Lehrer that he was qualified to be president because &#8220;no one has sued the government more than me.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, I&#8217;m sure Nader would say that it was his ideas he wanted attention for, not himself. But if the movement was really all he cared about, he probably would have listened when twelve of his most prominent former acolytes wrote an open letter begging him to stop his kamikaze strategy of telling everyone there was no difference between the two major candidates. Not only did Nader ignore them, he doubled down, campaigning extensively in Florida as election day approached.</p><p>We all know how the story ends. Nader tipped the election to Bush, who did such a bad job that even his own party completely repudiated his legacy. The war on terror caused far more death and destruction than Nader&#8217;s seatbelt mandates ever prevented. And just like that other Bush, Jeb!, Ralph Nader ended his career as a joke, remembered more for his one epic faceplant than for any of his actual accomplishments.</p><p></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>&nbsp;At the time, it wasn&#8217;t a sure thing that this delegation of congressional powers was constitutional, but it has since become such a core part of how our government works that most people don&#8217;t even realize it only dates back to the 20th century.

Past AI progress doesn&#8217;t speed up future AI progress. The field moves forward at some constant rate.</p><p>The second graph shows a world with a gradual &#8220;slow&#8221; takeoff. Early AIs (eg <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex">Codex</a>) speed up AI progress a little. Intermediate AIs (eg an AI that can help predict optimal parameter values) might speed up AI research more. Later AIs (eg autonomous near-human level AIs) could do the vast majority of AI research work, speeding it up many times. We would expect the early stages of this process to take slightly less time than we would naively expect, and the latter stages to take much less time, since AIs are doing most of the work.</p><p>The third graph shows a world with a sudden &#8220;fast&#8221; takeoff. Maybe there&#8217;s some single key insight that takes AIs from &#8220;mere brute-force pattern matchers&#8221; to &#8220;true intelligence&#8221;. Whenever you get this insight, AIs go from far-below-human-level to human-level or beyond, no gradual progress necessary.</p><p>Before, I mentioned one reason Davidson doesn&#8217;t like these terms - &#8220;slow takeoff&#8221; can be fast. It&#8217;s actually worse than this; in some sense, a &#8220;slow takeoff&#8221; will necessarily be faster than a &#8220;fast takeoff&#8221; - if you superimpose the red and blue graphs above, the red line will be higher at every point<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>. CCF departs from this terminology in favor of trying to predict a particular length of takeoff in real time units. Specifically, it asks: how long will it take to go from the kind of early-to-intermediate AI that can automate 20% of jobs, to the truly-human-level AI that can automate 100% of jobs?</p><p>(&#8220;Can automate&#8221; here means &#8220;is theoretically smart enough to automate&#8221; - actual automation will depend on companies fine-tuning it for specific tasks and providing it with the necessary machinery; for example, even a very smart AI can&#8217;t do plumbing until someone connects it to a robot body to do the dirty work. CCF will talk more about these kinds of considerations later.)</p><p>In order to figure this out, it needs to figure out the interplay of a lot of different factors. I&#8217;m going to focus on the three I find most interesting:</p><ol><li><p>How much more compute does it take to train the AI that can automate 100% of the economy, compared to the one that can automate 20%?</p></li><li><p>How will existing AI produce feedback loops that speed (or slow) AI progress?</p></li><li><p>What are the bottlenecks to AI&#8217;s ability to speed AI progress, and how much do they matter?</p></li></ol><h2>How Much More Compute Does It Take To Train The AI That Can Automate 100% Of The Economy, Compared To The One That Can Automate 20%?</h2><p>Like Bio Anchors, CCF ranks all current and future AIs on a one-dimensional scale: how much effective compute does takes to train them? It assumes that more effective compute = more intelligence. See <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/biological-anchors-a-trick-that-might">the discussion of Bio Anchors</a> for a justification of this assumption.</p><p>(everyone agrees that software/algorithmic progress can make AIs work better even with the same amount of compute; &#8220;effective compute&#8221; means &#8220;compute adjusting for software/algorithmic progress&#8221;)</p><p>Training a current AI like GPT-4 takes about 10^24 FLOPs of compute<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a>. Bio Anchors has already investigated how much compute it would take to train a human-level AI; their median estimate is 10^35 FLOPs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a>.</p><p>Current AI (10^24 FLOPs) can&#8217;t do very many jobs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>. Human level AI (10^35 FLOPs) by definition can do 100% of jobs. The AI that can do 20% of jobs must be somewhere in between. So the compute difference must be less than 12 orders of magnitude (OOMs)<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>.</p><p>Current AI seems far from doing 20% of jobs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a>, so Davidson artificially subtracts 3 OOMs to represent the lowest number at which it seems maybe possible that we would reach this level. Now we&#8217;re at a 9 OOM gap.</p><p>It seems like maybe dumb people can do 20% of jobs, so an AI that was as smart as a dumb human could reach the 20% bar. The compute difference between dumb and smart humans, based on brain size and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/">neuron number</a>, is less than 1 OOM, so this suggests a very small gap. But AI can already do some things dumb humans can&#8217;t (like write coherent essays with good spelling and punctuation), so maybe this is a bad way of looking at things.</p><p>GPT-4 is better than GPT-3, but maybe not the same amount of better that an AI that did 100% of human jobs would have to be over an AI that did 20% of human jobs. That suggests the gap is bigger than the 2 OOMs that separate GPT-4 from GPT-3.</p><p>Using a lot of hand-wavy considerations like these, Davidson estimates the effective FLOP gap with a probability distribution between 1 and 9 OOMs, densest around 4 OOMs.</p><h2>How Will AI Produce Feedback Loops That Speed (Or Slow) AI Progress?</h2><p>Davidson&#8217;s model looks like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png" width="566" height="413" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:413,&quot;width&quot;:566,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0438265b-2890-4f2f-97fa-3162b164d46a_566x413.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>First, AI will look exciting in rigged demos. This will convince investors to pour more money into AI, meaning AI companies can afford bigger training runs (at the same $/FLOP cost), meaning AI progress goes faster.</p><p>Second, AI can speed up AI research directly, both in the boring sense where this is happening today (eg Codex) and the exciting sense where one day they can design entire new computer systems without our help.</p><p><strong>AI Will Look Exciting And Spark Investor Interest</strong></p><p>Way back in January 2023 when Davidson released his report, this hadn&#8217;t happened yet. He was just speculating that it might. </p><p>He models this with a discontinuity called &#8220;wakeup time&#8221;. Before wakeup time, compute grows at its current rate, with only a few risk-seeking investors willing to spend money on compute for AI training runs.</p><p>After wakeup time, everyone realizes AI is a big deal, and the amount of money available for AI training runs goes way up.</p><p>Davidson guesses wakeup time will happen around 2034, which now feels way too conservative. Are we <em>already</em> past wakeup time? I&#8217;m not sure - one of Davidson&#8217;s analogies is a wartime footing, and I don&#8217;t feel like we&#8217;ve gotten quite that obsessed with AI funding yet.  Realistically a single &#8220;wakeup time&#8221; was a modeling decision made for the sake of convenience, and wakeup is a gradual process which has started but will get more intense as time goes on.</p><p>The model has AI investment grow at approximately its current rate until wakeup time, then grow at some higher rate similar to investment in munitions during wartime, or the highest rate at which the semiconductor industry has grown during periods of intense investment in the past.</p><p><strong>AI Will Automate Research Directly</strong></p><p>I was surprised to learn that economics already has well-known models for dealing with this kind of question. The key is that AI substituting for human labor is just a special case of capital substituting for human labor, something people have been modeling forever. The relevant tool is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_elasticity_of_substitution">constant elasticity of substitution model</a>.</p><p>I can&#8217;t follow the full math, but I appreciated this sample problem (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw1pTbLi2brrEP0DcsZMAVhlKp6TKGKNUSFRkkdP_hs/edit#">source</a>, <a href="https://www.planned-obsolescence.org/continuous-doesnt-mean-slow/">further discussion</a>):</p><blockquote><p>[How long will it take AGI to double the quality of AI software? The answer] depends on i) how many human researcher-years are needed to double software when we first get AGI, and ii) how many AGIs you can run (where each AGI is as productive as a human per day).</p><p>Here&#8217;s a very rough estimate of (i). If there are 20,000 high-quality human researchers on software today and software doubles every ~2 years then it currently takes 40,000 researcher years to double 2020-FLOP per FLOP. Let&#8217;s assume this is ~100X higher by the time we get AGI due to diminishing returns from the research that happens before then. That implies ~4 million researcher-years to double software when we get AGI.&nbsp;</p><p>To estimate (ii), suppose you trained AGI with 1e32 2020-FLOP, the training run took 4 months, afterwards you used 10% of your training compute to run AGIs doing software research, and running an AGI required 1e16 2020-FLOP/s. With these conservative assumptions, you&#8217;ll have 100 million AGIs doing software research and so the first software doubling will take ~1 months.</p></blockquote><p>That is: it takes much more compute to train an AI than to run it. Once you have enough compute to train an AI smart enough to do a lot of software research, you have enough compute to run 100 million copies of that AI<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a>. 100 million copies is enough to do a <em>lot</em> of software research. If software research is parallelizable (ie if nine women can produce one baby per month - the analysis will investigate this assumption later), that means you can do it really fast.</p><h2>What Are The Bottlenecks To AI Speeding Up AI Progress?</h2><p>This is another case where armchair futurists have been arguing in circles for decades, and Davidson just turns the whole problem into a parameter that he can plug into a standard economic model. It&#8217;s pretty refreshing.</p><p>The argument: suppose you have a superintelligent AI. It can do amazing things like design a working starship with mere seconds of thought. Sounds like we&#8217;ll have working starships pretty soon, right?</p><p>No, say the skeptics. Imagine that this starship is as far beyond us as we are beyond the ancient Romans. And imagine going back to ancient Rome with the schematics for a stealth bomber. Even if you understand all the tech perfectly, and all the Romans were on board with helping you, it would take centuries to laboriously build up the coal industry, then the oil industry, then the steel industry, then the aluminum industry, then the plastics industry, then the microchip industry, and so on, before you could even begin to assemble the bomber itself. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png" width="395" height="376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:376,&quot;width&quot;:395,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:269452,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7bd947-4ca2-434a-ab6c-0b3e4b6a1b19_395x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">DALL-E: &#8220;The ancient Romans build a B-2 stealth bomber.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure how stealthy this would be, but it&#8217;s not like the Visigoths have great radar.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Wait, say the believers. The superintelligent AI doesn&#8217;t need to wait for humans to advance to the tech level where they can build its starship. If it&#8217;s so smart, it can design starship-factory-building robots! If the starship needs antimatter, it can design antimatter-factory-building robots! And so on.</p><p>No, say the skeptics - who&#8217;s going to build these starship-factory-building robots? Humans, that&#8217;s who. And humans don&#8217;t currently have a robotics industry that can plausibly build something so advanced. Starship-factory-building-robots are step N-2 on the N-step path to building a starship, and each of these steps are going to take a long time.</p><p>Wait, say the believers! If the AI&#8217;s so smart, it can come up with clever ways to retool existing technology to make starship-factory-building robots really quickly! Or it can genetically engineer micro-organisms to build starship-factory-building robots! Or it can create nanomachines! Or . . . </p><p>Eventually this all bottoms out in claims about what kind of technological progress something much smarter than us can think up. Obviously we are not smart enough to assess this clearly, so the debate endures.</p><p>In Davidson&#8217;s model, we&#8217;re mostly talking about AI design technologies. A lot of AI design is software work, which seems promising - if you&#8217;re smart enough to code really good software, you can just do that, no factories needed. But current AI design also involves compute-heavy training runs and hard-to-manufacture microchips. There&#8217;s no substitute for waiting months for your compute-heavy training run to finish, and chips require complicated chip fabs that you can&#8217;t just think into existence.</p><p>In the believers&#8217; world, with few bottlenecks, these 100 million new software-design AIs that you just created can do 100 million times the work of a human workers, and software design will happen blindingly fast. In the extreme case, intellectual work is so cheap, and everything else so expensive, that AI routes around everything that requires training or new chips; see the discussion of &#8220;software-only singularity&#8221; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw1pTbLi2brrEP0DcsZMAVhlKp6TKGKNUSFRkkdP_hs/edit">in the appendices here</a>.</p><p>In the skeptics&#8217; world, software development is bottlenecked by compute and chip manufacturing. The first few thousand of these AIs will do all the work you can do without waiting for a long training run and a new chip fab. Then they&#8217;ll just sit there uselessly until the long training run happens and the new chip fab gets built. Software development might go a little faster, but not by much.</p><p>(of course, you&#8217;ll have other very smart AIs working on obtaining more compute and building chip fabs quicker - the question is whether there are some tasks that inherently bottleneck the process no matter how much cognitive labor you&#8217;re throwing at the whole chain)</p><p>Davidson&#8217;s economic solution to this problem is a parameter called <em>&#961;</em> in the CES models, which represent how bottlenecked a process is - to what degree capital can 100% substitute for labor across all tasks, versus whether everything will be held up by a few tasks that are inherently labor-heavy. In the AI context, it represents the degree to which progress gets slowed done by tasks that AI can&#8217;t perform (because slow humans have to do it, or because the task requires some physical machinery). Models can set <em>&#961; </em>at 0 (representing no bottlenecks), positive numbers (meaning labor and capital are substitutes) or negative numbers (meaning labor gets bottlenecked by a lack of capital, or vice versa). </p><p>Davidson says that in the economic contexts most similar to this, <em>&#961; = </em>-0.5, and plugs that into his model.</p><h2>So How Fast Is Takeoff?</h2><p>I&#8217;ve just gone over the highlights. Davidson&#8217;s full model has sixteen main parameters and fifty &#8220;additional parameters&#8221;. Each is represented as a distribution of possible values.</p><p>He goes on to do a Monte Carlo simulation, where he selects one possible value from the distribution of each variable, and simulates the resulting world. Then he averages out all those simulations to get a &#8220;mainline world&#8221;.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

much compute the biggest AI in each year probably has.</p><p>In 2022, AIs had around 10^24 FLOPs. Davidson expects this to grow by about an OOM per year for a while, mostly because companies and investors are getting more excited about AI and paying for bigger training runs, although a little of this is also software and hardware progress. The line might go a little bit up or down based on the size of investor pocketbooks and when &#8220;wakeup time&#8221; happens.</p><p>Around 2040, AI will reach the point where it can do a lot of the AI and chip research process itself. Research will speed up VERY VERY FAST. AI will make more progress in two years than in decades of business-as-usual. Most of this progress will be in software, although hardware will also get a big boost.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></p><p>So this is the mainline scenario.

Forecasters rig their model to match whatever the current vibes are. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a conscious, sinister process. It just means that you have a lot of parameters, and if your model gives an insane result, you reconsider your parameter value estimates. And then you keep doing that until your model gives the sanest result of all, ie the one that exactly matches the current vibes.</p><p>The current vibes are human-level AI in the 2030s or early 2040s. CCF says 2043, so it matches the vibes very well. This doesn&#8217;t mean Davidson necessarily rigged it. Maybe it&#8217;s just a really great model.</p><p>But I do have one concern: CCF has to predict human-level AI sooner than Bio Anchors, since it adds a consideration (intelligence explosion) which accelerates AI. The original Bio Anchors said 2052, so CCF&#8217;s 2043 is a reasonable correction.</p><p>But a few months ago, Ajeya Cotra of Bio Anchors <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines">updated her estimate to 2040</a>. Some of this update was because she read CCF and was convinced, but some was because of other considerations. Now CCF is later than (updated) Bio Anchors. Someone is wrong and needs to update, which might mean we should think of CCF as predicting earlier than 2043. I suggest discovering some new consideration which allows a revision to the mid-2030s, which would also match the current vibes.</p><p>What about takeoff speeds?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png" width="667" height="337" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:337,&quot;width&quot;:667,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:18860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73b3bc00-d06b-41d1-b03a-f5bfd716f415_667x337.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I&#8217;m less cynical about this one. There are no pre-existing vibes about takeoff speeds. Also, this sounds kind of crazy, which is a good sign that it isn&#8217;t rigged.</p><p>From when AI can do 20% of jobs, Davidson expects it will only take about 3 years for it to be able to do 100% of jobs. This would be less worrying if I was sure that AI couldn&#8217;t do 20% of jobs <em>now</em>.</p><p>Finally:</p><blockquote><p>How much time from AGI to superintelligence? This has not been my main focus, but the framework has implications for this question. My best guess is that we go from AGI (AI that can perform ~100% of cognitive tasks as well as a human professional) to superintelligence (AI that very significantly surpasses humans at ~100% of cognitive tasks) in 1 - 12 months. The main reason is that AGI will allow us to &gt;10X our software R&amp;D efforts, and software (in the &#8220;algorithmic efficiency&#8221; sense defined above: effective FLOP per actual FLOP) is already doubling roughly once per year. </p></blockquote><p>Yeah, this is an obvious implication of this model. He who has ears to hear, let him listen.</p><h2>Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Part - The Sensitivity Analysis</h2><p>No, really, this is important.</p><p>Partly because every number in this model is at best an educated guess and at worst a wild guess. If small changes in their value change the result a lot, it&#8217;s useless. If the result stays steady across a wide range of plausible changes, then it&#8217;s worth taking seriously.</p><p>But also, <a href="https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/693718279721730048/on-bio-anchors">Nostalgebraist argues that </a>Bio Anchors hinges almost entirely on Moore&#8217;s Law.

But it&#8217;s harder to set the parameters to a value where there isn&#8217;t some kind of intelligence explosion, ie an &#8220;S&#8221; shape on the hardware and (especially) software progress curves. </p><p>One way to remove the explosion is to choose a very low value for &#8220;R&amp;D parallelization penalty&#8221;. This term represents the fact that &#8220;nine women can&#8217;t make one baby per month&#8221;; at some point adding more simultaneous labor doesn&#8217;t speed up tasks as much as you&#8217;d think, because the tasks have to be done in a certain order, or communication problems eat up all the gains. Setting this close to zero means there&#8217;s not much benefit to your 100 million AI laborers and intelligence doesn&#8217;t really explode.</p><p>Another way to remove the explosion is to set &#8220;labor substitution R&amp;D&#8221; close to zero. I think this is <em>&#961;</em>, the bottleneck constant discussed above. A number close to zero means that bottlenecks completely dominate, and your 100 million AI laborers spend all their time waiting for some normal human to run the chip manufacturing conveyor belt.</p><p>My impression is that preventing the intelligence explosion requires setting these to values that don&#8217;t really match observations from real world economics. But having 100 million disembodied cognitive laborers is a pretty unusual situation and maybe it will turn out to be unprecedentedly bottlenecked or non-parallelizable.</p><p>There must be a few other things that can remove the intelligence explosion, because switching from the &#8220;best guess&#8221; to &#8220;conservative&#8221; preset on the Playground removes it even when I manually set those two parameters back to their normal values. But it&#8217;s not any of the big obvious things, and most changes push timelines backward or forward a bit without altering the shape of the curve.</p><h2>Contra MIRI On Takeoff Speeds</h2><p>A lot of these big complicated analyses are salvos in a long-running conflict between a school of futurists based at Open Philanthropy and another school based at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.</p><p>The OP school expect the rise of AI to be gradual, multipolar, and potentially survivable.

there will be a discontinuity at 10^34 FLOPs in particular, or even that the discontinuity will be caused by reaching any particular amount of training compute. Just that someone might develop a new paradigm of AI that works much better than deep learning, and all of these arguments about compute will become irrelevant.</p><p>Why does MIRI expect something like this? I think lots of reasons, some of them pretty arcane, but the most popular one for debate has been the chimp/human transition. It intuitively feels like lemurs, gibbons, chimps, and <em>homo erectus</em> were all more or less just monkey-like things plus or minus the ability to wave sharp sticks - and then came <em>homo sapiens</em>, with the potential to build nukes and travel to the moon. In other words, there wasn&#8217;t a smooth evolutionary landscape, there was a discontinuity where a host of new capabilities became suddenly possible. Once AI crosses that border, we should expect to be surprised by how much more powerful it becomes.</p><p>Since then, many people have criticized this argument. Paul Christiano objections that evolution wasn&#8217;t directly optimizing chimps for engineering skills, so there was an engineering-skills overhang that got unbottlenecked all at once; for other objections, see <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvz9qjWyv8cLX9JJR/evolution-provides-no-evidence-for-the-sharp-left-turn">Evolution Provides No Argument For The Sharp Left Turn</a>.  Davidson <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZy1qgSal2xwDRR0wOPBroYE_RDV1_2vvhwVz4dxCVc/edit#heading=h.4cerpuh035a6">tries to steelman</a> MIRI&#8217;s scenario: imagine evolution was optimizing for speed. It created cheetahs, falcons, etc. Then by some freak coincidence, it creates humans (even though they are not very fast). Humans proceed to invent cars and rockets. Now it&#8217;s obvious that humans are a paradigm shift, and the overhang argument is neutralized.</p><p>Davidson&#8217;s response is just sort of &#8220;yeah, maybe, I guess&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>This argument does update me towards C=&#8220;maybe some new AI technique will be developed over the course of a few months and cause AI capabilities to improve OOMs faster&#8221;.</p><p>But the update is relatively small (this feels like evidence i&#8217;m ~2-3X as likely to see in worlds where C is true):</p><p>We haven&#8217;t actually observed &#8216;hypothetical evolution&#8217; so don&#8217;t know what would happen.</p><p>Even if we had, it&#8217;s just one example so provides limited evidence.</p><p>Evolution is different from &#8220;the process of AI R&amp;D&#8221; in some important ways. (They would be much more analogous if AI R&amp;D simply consisted of one massive gradient descent training run. I flesh this out in the final objection, which I find pretty convincing.)</p><p>This line of argument can be interpreted as &#8220;evidence for an extremely narrow FLOP gap&#8221;, but the evidence seems more speculative and indirect than the numerous <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw1pTbLi2brrEP0DcsZMAVhlKp6TKGKNUSFRkkdP_hs/edit#heading=h.o4db3tcgrq28">other sources of evidence</a> I considered. So it doesn&#8217;t seem like this should substantially shift my probability distribution over the FLOP gap.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not sure why exactly you would think of this as a FLOP gap. A sufficiently new paradigm might allow better results with <em>fewer</em> FLOPs, not just a smaller increase in FLOPs than you would otherwise expect. And it could come at any point along the FLOP progress graph - you wouldn&#8217;t need to reach 10^34 FLOPs to get it; a sufficiently smart person might be able to come up with it today.</p><p>Still, I don&#8217;t think any of this really matters. Davidson is admitting he&#8217;s not really modeling this, and if this is how you think of things you will not like his model. This is a model about how the current paradigm will proceed; you can take it or leave it.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Like skiing down Everest, near-future AI capabilities progress may be simultaneously gradual, continuous, and fast. Also exhilarating, terrifying, and potentially fatal to the unprepared.</p><p>Since everything will happen faster than we think, we will want to have plans beforehand. We need clear criteria for when AI labs will halt progress to reassess safety - not just because current progress is fast, but because progress will get faster just when it becomes most dangerous.</p><p>Sometime in the next few years or decades, someone will create an AI which can perform an appreciable fraction of all human tasks. Millions of copies will be available almost immediately<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a>, with many running at faster-than-human speed. Suddenly, everyone will have access to a super-smart personal assistant who can complete cognitive tasks in seconds. A substantial fraction of the workforce will be fired; the remainder will see their productivity skyrocket. The pace of technological progress will advance by orders of magnitude, including progress on even smarter AI assistants. Within months, years at most, your assistant will be smarter than you are and hundreds of millions of AIs will be handling every facet of an increasingly futuristic-looking economy.</p><p>When this happens, Tom Davidson and OpenPhil will be able to say &#8220;We drew a curve whose shape sort of corresponds to this process.&#8221; It probably won&#8217;t feel very reassuring.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Is this just an artifact of where I put the fast takeoff cliff on the graph? The broader point is that if there is some quantum leap waiting somewhere along the AI progress slope, we will get to it faster if we model AIs self-improving gradually until then, instead of humans doing AI research alone. Put another way, the people in <a href="https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1646284544838909953">this picture of fast takeoff</a> get to the cliff faster than they would if they weren&#8217;t even-a-little in the slow takeoff world.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Although some estimates for GPT-4 are closer to 10^25 FLOPs.
